1	Is matter converted into energy in a black hole? Matter does not just disappear.  Something is happening to it. None of us posting here will be able to tell you the answer here with any certanty, but the theory that I'd most redaly accept would be that no it does not.  All matter entering a black hole is compressed incredibly in to a very (cosmically speaking) small amount of space.  This pressure and proximity cause a huge build up of energy, but the matter is not lost.  Also the incredible amount of matter in that space creates large gravatational fields.  If the matter was converted into energy the hole would lose its power to capture more matter.

1	can we dig the land in at a place till it reaches to another side of the world.? if we make the hollow place for travelling like trains. if we out 1 time a train into it. then it would oscillates and we can  make more profit in travel areas. You forget that we will accelerate towards the mean point and then slow down as we go the other extreme. Also oscillations such as those will be impeded by a lot of problems, the chief among them would be friction.\n\nThe cost of digging the tunnel would shadow all the profits incurred. If a mishap occurs in the tunnel, the people are done for.\n\nConsider the EuroTunnel between England and France.

3	Are you an excellent story-writer? If you are, is it because of personal experience or conversations or writing techniques that helped you accomplish this? It is all three, but people write best about what they know.  People write about their personal experiences.  The writing techniques can be learned, but I do believe that the ability to write in a way that interests others is a gift.  A good writer can tell a story about the simplest event and have it be interesting to the readers.  A good writer is talking to each reader personally.  \n\nGood writers are constantly listening and watching.  They have the ability to take what they hear and see and assimilate it and store it away for future use.  And most of all, good writers are always writing.  Here at Yahoo Answers is one of the places I get practice right now.  I write here everyday.  Feel free to have a look at some of my other answers - not all of them are examples of good writing as they are often written quickly and without deep thought.  However, I do write about what I know.  Good writers want to share what they know and are pleased when people read it.\n\nI hope my thoughts are of help.

7	Did I screw up my Disney audition today? I had a very early audition today.  I dropped a name of a former Actor who said he was a Disney guy.  Not a soul new him.  It put me in a weird place as they said, "who?" Then everyone asked if everyone knew him and NO one did. Sometimes name dropping works and other times it works against you. Sorry to say, it did the latter. I wouldn't let it stop you, though; I'm sure every actor/singer/etc. has done something they weren't proud of on at least one audition. If entertainment is what you really want to do, GO FOR IT!!! :)

4	Difference between threshold and watermarking. anyone know?? I'm trying to understand the fundamental difference between setting thresold and setting watermark.? What in plain english it means ? While I understand threshold is something that when crossed becomes not usable. On the other hand there is low water mark and high water mark. When I associate threshold with watermark I don't see much difference. Any answers would be greatly helpful The article below details watermarking and includes reference to threshold. Threshold is the security measure (ie. how secure it is)of the watermark as far as I can make out. A threshold of zero would form a fragile watermark more susceptible to attack.

2	how can i get rid of my strecthmarks for a short time, and also, how can i make my penis bigger? i have a 4 inches when erect cock and i want it to be bigger. i also have stretchmarks since i was kind fat when i was a child. Hope you guys can help me, since it will also boost my self confidence when im with other people. and one last thing, i am only 16 years old. You really cannot get rid of stretchmarks, quickly or slowly, without plastic surgery. You can apply makeup to minimize them, and there are some applications that claim to help shrink them, but I am not aware of any that have been tested and found to work.\n\nThere is no way to enlarge your penis, although, since you're 16, it may get a bit bigger over the next couple of years. The only way to get a much bigger penis is to have a penile transplant, with all the usual problems of transplants. Better to learn how to treat a woman well, because you will have better luck finding a woman who likes you the way you are. There are attachments you can use to help satisfy a woman who has to have a large penis to get her off, though they don't do much for you.\n\nMaybe by the time you're in your 20s, the rabid Republican religious right will no longer control the government, and researchers will be able to find out how to give you a longer penis without surgery, as well as replace hearts and other organs with your own tissue.
1	How do you build tunnels underwater? One of the gracious Yahoo! Ask the Planet headquarters hostesses from the Hard Rock Cafe just asked this question of the Brainiacs in the big purple brain in Times Square, and we thought we would invite you all to help us out with this one.  Who knows the answer? There are several ways to build tunnels underwater.\n\nOne way is to build sections of tubes in advance, float them into position using tugboats, sink them, have divers go down and seal the sections together, and then pump the water out.\n\nA more traditional way is to dig a tunnel far enough below the sea bottom that the rock over them keeps out the water.  It's kind of like digging a mine,\n\nIf the rock or soil isn't able to keep out all the water while the tunnel is being dug, sometimes it's possible to pump compressed air into the tunnel, so the pressure inside the tunnel is greater than the water pressure outside, and have workers seal the inside of the tunnel with a concrete or steel lining.

5	Hockey question? What is +/- mean in hockey?  I am guessing it could mean goals scored Vs goals allowed when a particular person is on the ice....but if that is the case, wouldn't it be hard for the officials to determine who is out on the ice each time? every team has statisticians at every game, and the NHL does too, I think, to gather all the information.\nA goal is scored for your team when your on the ice gives you a plus 1. If your on the ice when you get scored upon, you get a minus 1. This is not so much indicative of the player, more for the team strength and when a player is on the ice. Offensive forwards generally have plus ratings. Even the best defense man may have a minus rating. A strong team that scores a lot and everyone on the team may be a plus.

1	What do you think would happen if you shot someone with Antimatter? What is Antimatter? What are your thoughts? I read your question "What would happen if I shot someone with an antimatter bullet?"  It is right in that matter and antimatter annihilate each other on contact, and are in fact drawn magnetically to each other to mutual detonation.  If in fact the particles could last so long as to leave the gun fly through the air without detonation (we may assume some sort of magnetic container) the bullet becomes a small antimatter missile, or bomb, with a few grams, maybe ounces of antimatter.  When such a payload of antimatter explodes there is a large gamma radiation burst, one pound of which would be more powerful than the first atomic bombs, detonated over Japan at the end of WWII.   The conclusion i draw is there would be a massive explosion that would devastate an area the size of a small city, from a single antimatter bullet.  Makes one think.  \n\n- LOVE YOUR NIEGHBOR AS YOURSELF

I have a lump in the right half of my throat, right beside where the adams apple would be if i were male, when i push on it I feel it kinda ripple like there were  ripples going over  a speed bump, does anyone have this and what could it be You should have that check out by an ultrasound. When you press on the lump does it hurt?  How big would you estimate the lump is?  How long have you had it?  And does it hurt when you swallow?\nSome lumps are benign, but some may be cancerous.  If you have a swollen neck, you might have thyroid hormone problems.  Either way (lump or swollen gland), it should be treated as a serious problem.\nI had felt 2 lumps in my neck.  I had it checked out with an ultrasound.  It was benign, but it was caused from pimple/acne drainage.  The thyroid and lympatic system are all very sensitive areas for women.\nPlease have it checked by a physician.  You don't want it to grow to be a bigger problem.

5	Should Utah get a MLB baseball team?Explain.? The high altitude will lead to lots of high scoring games. The Royals could move there since there's really nothing for them in KC. The only down part may be the beer sales since most of the state's Mormon. The Royals  have  a lot of history in KC so they probibly wont more. And MLB doesnt like the high altitude. They are trying to do everything to make the ball fly less in Coors Field, so why would they want a new field. I think the high altitude ruins the game, because it just makes the hitters look better, when they arent actually that good.

9	for all you dems out there.? For all you dems out there?\nWhy is it that though you're all supposed to be so sophisticated, you do nothing but take shots at reps like me.

If Dems ran things we'd still be debating Iraq and half of you would say go while the other half said no and yet no one would take any real side on the matter. I am proud to say that though I'm an asthmatic, I still go to my local MC recruiter and will be enlisting in the corps in Dec. 2007 so I can actually do something for my country instead of complain about it. Instead of making comments about the way the country is run why don't you move to Canada? \n\n ---I want to respond to some of your criticisms. \n\n\n1 I have to wait till 2007 so i can train, beating asthma aint easy.\n\n2 I don't live in a vacuum.

I dont understand why anyone would willingly join to fight this war but it is your decision and its your life. So good luck to you.

Ask him to stay in touch via telephone, e-mail etc and then just wait and see what happens.  Perhaps he will be flattered and keep in touch.
6	Does anyone know any place that will hire my child: 14-15 year olds this summer for a job in Columbia, SC? Usually Taco Bell hires the younger youth. You might want to consider volunteering-in a capacity that your child enjoys. It builds up references, local networks, and experience. Not to mention, the child learns good workplace soft skills such as how to take orders from a superior, co-existing peacefully with co-workers, and how to deal with challenges.

2	At Home Laser Teeth Whitening Product Help? Hi guys I'm just wondering if anyone has tried the AT HOME version for Laser teeth whitening, the price is like a fifth of that of having it done professionally at the dentist but the products claim to have the same effects. The product comes with all the gels you need and the actual laser light attachement, I'm wondering if this is the same strength of the professional laser system. Does anyone know if this is true before I make a costly mistake with little effect at all? \n\nI have had my teeth lasered once before by Britesmile in July of last year and they seem to have discoloured again slightly, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I'm in the UK too. \n\nI want BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT white Hollywood teeth and if at home laser whitening is good then I will purchase. Any other ideas on how to achieve this wouldn't go amiss either!!!\n\nThanks! Well, there are lasers and there are LASERS.\nPerhaps you'll be just as well off using a laser pointer, because dental lasers are powerful beasties costing megabucks. Their intention is to activate the bleach by releasing H2O2 in a faster and higher fashion than home bleaching. You're not going to get a laser like that thru the mail, not to mention the safety considerations.\nIn any case, home bleaching has been found in studies to give better and longer-lasting effects than in-surgery bleaching.

That's why it's called the SOLAR system. But Mercury is the planet nearest to the sun.\n\nNew findings suggest that there could be TEN planets in this solar system. The number of planets is random (or it appears to be). When the big bang happened, the sun attracted mass to itself as it oscillated, and the planets were formed.

1	Is it a coincidence that humans ordinarily have five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot? There was a lobe finned fish that evolved into all the terestrial vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds).  Its bone structure included four lobe fins that became the four limbs (thus the name tetrapods) and each had five rays, the bone structure that has become digits.  The five fingers / five toes is a result of the creature that moved onto land.

1	y is it wen you say a word over and over it eventually loses its meaning...? Applies to other senses as well. If you stare at a picture for long enough it also tends to lose it's meaning. Everything only has meaning when it is put into context with something else, how it interacts with other objects. Take an object out of it's normal context, isolate it and it loses something. Take that same object and place it with objects that it would normally never be seen with and it takes on a whole new meaning, this was the idea of the art movement of Surrealism and a mechanism for exploring the technique of lateral thinking. When a word is repeated over and over it loses it's meaning because the brain kind of 'loses interest' in it's normal activity of associating the word with other words and meanings leaving it with nothing but the literal input of the sound of the word itself.

5	what is offences system of basketball ? First of all, it isn't OFFENCES, it's offense. Now, I don't understand what you're asking, but here you go:\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAlthough the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have evolved as part of basketball. During the first five decades of basketball's evolution, two guards, two forwards, and one center were used. Since the 1980s, more specific positions have evolved, namely point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward and center. On some occasions, teams will choose to use a three guard offense, replacing one of the forwards or the center with a third guard.\n\nTwo main defense concepts are used: zone defense and man-to-man defense. Zone defense involves players in defensive positions, guarding whichever opponent is in their zone. In man-to-man defense, each defensive player guards and follows a specific opponent and tries to prevent him from taking action. Variations of these two main structures are used.\n\nOffensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball. A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is a cut. A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent marking a teammate, by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a screen or pick. The two plays are combined in the pick and roll, in which a player sets a pick and then "rolls" away from the pick towards the basket. Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork which can lead to a successful basket. Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable. On court, the point guard is generally responsible for indicating which play will occur.\n\nDefensive and offensive structures, and positions, are more emphasised in higher levels in basketball; it is these that a coach normally requests a time-out to discuss.\n\n\nShooting\n \nPlayer releases a short jump shot, while her defender is either knocked down, or trying to "take a charge."Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket. While methods can vary with players and situations, the most common technique can be outlined here.\n\nThe player holds the ball to rest in the dominant hand's fingertips (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand on the side of the ball. The ball is shot by extending the shooting arm to become straight; the ball rolls off the finger tips while the wrist completes a full downward flex motion. Generally, the non-shooting arm is only used to guide the shot, not to power it.\n\nPlayers often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to deaden its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat arguable, but generally coaches will profess proper arch. Most players shoot directly into the basket, but in certain situations the shooter may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.\n\nThe two most common shots are the set shot and the jump shot. The set shot is taken from a standing position, with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws. The jump shot is taken while in mid-air, near the top of the jump. This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender.\n\nThe best shooters have good coordination, balance, courage and are well practiced. Realizing a shooting opportunity and using it is as important as basic technique; top players at the professional level rarely miss when given an unguarded look at the basket.\n\n\nPassing\n \nCarlos Arroyo shown here with the Utah Jazz, left, passes to a teammate.A pass is a method of moving the ball between players. Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.\n\nOne of the most basic passes is the chest 
2	What happens during REM sleep? What Is REM Sleep?\n\nUsually, REM sleep occurs 90 minutes after sleep onset. The first period of REM typically lasts 10 minutes, with each recurring REM stage lengthening, and the final one may last up to an hour. Polysomnograms show brainwave patterns in REM to be similar to that recorded during wakefulness. In people without sleep disorders, heart rate and respiration speed up and become erratic during REM sleep. During this stage the eyes move rapidly in different directions.\n\nIntense dreaming occurs during REM sleep as a result of heightened brain activity, but paralysis occurs simultaneously in the major voluntary muscle groups. REM is a mixture of encephalic (brain) states of excitement and muscular immobility. For this reason, it is sometimes called paradoxical sleep.\n\nThe percentage of REM sleep is highest during infancy and early childhood. During adolescence and young adulthood, the percentage of REM sleep declines. Infants can spend up to 50% of their sleep in the REM stage of sleep, whereas adults spend only about 20% in REM.
6	has anyone had to get there wisdom teeth out? does it hurt? yes, and yes.\nof course, I had all 4 out at once and they were severely impacted, so that probably had a great deal to do with the pain... but my face swelled up like a chipmunk and it was an entire week before I could eat *anything* non-liquid.  I'd suggest (just in case) that you're smarter than I was and don't have this done right before a big eating holiday (Easter's coming up...)

5	is 4 months long enough to train for marathon iam running about 6 miles now? I'd assume you have 4 more months to train, but that should be a good amount of time. Gradually increase you average distance and don't run the same amount everyday obviously. Do a couple of 10 mile days and then on one day run 15. This'll get you used to suddenly running a lot because it'd obviously be torture on your body to run 26 miles everyday. But you could do that once in a while during your training, it'd be a good idea.

5	Who do you think should go number one in the baseball fantasy draft, Pujols or A-Rod? These two guys are the hands down the best two in baseball statistically. I would choose Pujols due to his all around great playing and his history of being injury free. You can count on him pretty much every day. A-rod is an all around type of player as well but he does not get as much rbi's due to the star line up they have and you can never tell when he may go down again. He has been injury free for a while but you never know. And right now Pujols has been really injury free.

4	I am having some problems with computer configuration after installing a wireless mouse and keyboard set!? It works fine after i install it but when i have to re-start the computer for any reason i am taken to a prompt screen telling me that my computer configuration has been changed and it gives me several options. one is to go into Windows in safe mode but lose my previous configuration, or it tells me to try to resart Windows normally or to try to go to the last correct configuration If i go to safe mode i lose my configuration and if i try to restart Windows or find the last correct configuration i am taken back to the prompt window that i started off with.\nI followed the instructions on the book and on the driver correctly and it keeps doing this. At every re-start i have to put the original keyboard and mouse back on and re-install the driver and the wireless units and then remove the old units and then wireless works fine until the next start-up. Can anyone help me? G'day,\n\nA few things come in minds.\n1. Try to download the latest driver/software for your wireless set from the manufacturer's website.  Make sure you uninstall the old driver/software before installing the new one.\nIf the previous suggestion does not work there are 2 possibilities as follows:\n2a. You may have a corrupted Operating System (I assume you are using Windows XP).  You may need to reformat your HDD and reinstall your operating system from scratch.  Please refer to some answers in Yahoo Answers about reformatting HDD and make sure you back up your data files before doing so.  This is gonna be a major work if you want to take this way\n2b. Pls dun get offended, but you might buy a cheap brand wireless set. I helped a few of my clients installing cheap/unknown wireless set that they bought themselves and it gives me alot of problems.  Once I suggest them to exchange with well-known brands wireless set (eg. Microsoft or Logitech), the hardware works perfectly without any problems.  So you may want to try this option first before reformatting HDD.\n\nHope this helps.  Good Luck :)

1	how did paper get its name?answer in paragraphs? The word paper comes from the ancient Egyptian writing material called "papyrus", which was woven from papyrus plants. \n\nPapyrus was produced as early as 3000 BCE in Egypt, and in ancient Greece and Rome. Further north, parchment or vellum, made of processed sheepskin or calfskin, replaced papyrus, as the papyrus plant requires subtropical conditions to grow. \n\nIn China, documents were ordinarily written on bamboo, making them very heavy and awkward to transport. Silk was sometimes used, but was normally too expensive to consider. Indeed, most of the above materials were rare and costly.\n\nArcheologically, true paper had been excavated in China dated from the 2nd-century BC. It spread slowly outside of China; other East Asian cultures, even after seeing paper, could not figure out how to make it themselves. Instruction in the manufacturing process was required, and the Chinese were reluctant to share their secrets. The technology was first transferred to Korea in 600 and then imported to Japan by a Buddhist priest.\n\nAfter further commercial trading and the defeat of the Chinese in the Battle of Talas, the invention spread to the Middle East, where it was adopted in India and subsequently in Italy in about the 13th century. They used hemp and linen rags as a source of fiber. The oldest known paper document in the West is the Missel of Silos from the 11th century.

Its so unstable that the BIOS settings change from one use to the next.  Not only that, but sometimes it fails POST for memory and/or drives.\n\nI don't want to get another ASUS board because they don't support their products.  All they ever do is say to re-flash the BIOS, but doing so never fixes anything.  A friend has the same exact board and he is having the same problems.\n\nHowever, I think the Athlon processor is still good.  That is why I want to get a new athlon compatable motherboard with network, sound and usb built in.\n\nCan someone reccomend a *STABLE* ATX motherboard that is compatable with the Athlon?  It does not need video because I have a good AGP All-In-Wonder card.  It does need sound, usb and network though, but only one network (the asus had two but only one ever worked). Try the MSI KT880 Delta-FSR. This board has high ratings and reviews and supports the processor you have (I'm assuming its a Socket A). It also has the AGP slot for your video card. Four USB ports and a RJ-45 LAN port fits your needs, along with the 6-channel audio chip. All this for $54.99 on tigerdirect.com .

6	Should I keep my debt on a low interest Credit card or use my home equity for a loan to pay off.?? HI I have about $20000 in credit card debt that I have been conscientiously willowing down for a bit now. I plan to have it down to 0 in about 1 year and a half. Presently it is spread amongst 3 credit cards..two have 3.99% and one of them is at 1.99%...all until about August or so..then I imagine I can transfer them around again. My question is ..I have enough equity in my coop to be qualify for up to a $60,000 equity line of credit...at prime plus "0" ---I'm not sure if it is to my advantage to use this equity line of credit to pay off my credit card debts...provided I apply for it. I've heard that the interest is deductible..would this make the decision a slam dunk obvious one??or are there other factors to consider.. I think prime is at 7%? now? Thanks for your help.\n\nGeorge I have been reading so much about credit.  On many documents that I have read it's good that you have the balance spread out on all your credit cards.  The Equity Loan that you would get will be at a higher interest rate, so the best thing that I would probably suggest is to possibly  find a way to increase your credit score to possibly 720 or higher and then refi your home loan, because you will be able to get a better interest rate than consider paying off those balances with a lower interest rate.  \nP.S if you need more info on credit, I can defenitely give you some info..

I have not seen numbers for 2005, but have seen figures from 1975 and 1988 that indicate that approximately twice as many women file for divorce as do men, or about 66% of divorces (and some figures indicate as high as 75% of divorces) are filed by women.

1	Are all those weird cats and dogs Genetically Modified Organisms? The incredibly small, wrinkled, hairless or flat-faced ones. They would have never evolved the way they are without human intervention. Does that make them GMO? I think some of these answers may have too narrow of a definition of "genetically modified." What if we definite it broadly as "Getting the genes we want into the organisms we want"? Choosing the parents of any organism then is "genetic modification." Sexual reproduction and recombination are natural processes of genetic modification in animals and plants, as are hybridization and lateral transfer of DNA (through transposible elements, etc.).\n\nThe forms of genetic modification that some people object to -- taking DNA fragments containing genes of interest from one species and inserting them into another species -- occurs along a continuum with "normal" recombination.

Depends on how good a liar and juggler you are.\n\nWouldn't it be easiest simply to mention that you're seeing other girls?

")\n\nI have a friend who has had a lot of success juggling several girls, and it's because they know he's a player, but at least he's honest about it.

9	Doing jail time? I friend was given the sentence 2 years with half. And he is at a L.A. county but they will be moving him to a state prision in 2 weeks. He has already did a month about how much time will he do hey right now my husbands doing time in a state prison it sucks but about your friend if they have where they can work day for 2 days then he wont be surving the full sentence although there is a such thing as a judicial release basically he has to serve 30 days in state prison no jail no correctional facility he has to be in prison for the 30 days then his lawyer can file a judicial release but that means he could be on parole for like 5 years,or house arrest.Most of the time at least where my hubby is the judge is a bitch and on top of that a dyke so shes pretty hard on men and hasnt gave a judicial in like 10 years although we filed i even wrote a letter to the judge but  did me know good im sorry to hear about your friend i know it sucks but if they did the crime they will do the time but i would check into the judicial realease what was the charge anyways casue that also plays a big part if he is harmful the society they wont even consider it until a parole hearing has come up and about appealing it you better have damn good evidence as to why he shouldnt be there and be able to prove his innocence cause if you appeal it and the judge still finds him guilty they can up his time it all depends on the judge i hope my advice helps you good luck and tell your friend to hang in there it will go by fast is it there first time being incarcerated i know my husbands not going back he dont belong in there hes not no convict well he is now but hes nothing like the people there murders,child molesters shit like that thats sad he got caught with a stolen 4wheeler and got 6 months but the good thing about it he gets out on my b-day jan. 15th i cant wait ok well good luck
8	why are u happy? Happy actually not only a expression, but happy also good for our health...Happy also a choice, we can either live with better and more happy everyday? or we can choose sad and unhappy that make us look more worst in front of people or bad for our health plus may also effect our emotion too.\n\nso, be happy and start learn to enjoy life with what we have or left...as people that always require too much before they can happy will never become happy people :)

6	hi... my main problem with my life is Failure , every things i doing the end of them is failure.. thanks alots i need help what i do to be success with my life  thanks you so much The first step in acheiving success is believing in yourself.  When a person doesn't think they're smart enough or good enough, they often end up expecting failure, and get what they expected.\n\nYou could start with education.  The grammar in your question suggests this may be a weak area.  Whether you're in school or not, there are resources you can go to.  If you're still in school, talk to a counselor about getting extra help.  Maybe you have a learning disorder that hasn't been diagnosed.  If you're out of school, the local district proabably has adult classes available.  Having an education helps most people feel better about themselves, and also helps them present themselves to others more effectively.\n\nKeep a journal.  That will help you examine your feelings and learn to express yourself, as well.  When you have a bad day, review what you might have done differently in the journal, and how you think it might have changed the outcome.  \n\nI also recommend counseling or therapy to help you understand and deal with your feelings of failure and where they come from.  And remember this: the only true failure is the failure to try.  Never give up!
2	can a hiv infected person gain weight? i used to have sex with prostitudes...but since last two and a half years i have not had sex...and in the last six months i have gained five kgs of weight. well I am a HIV+ person and have been for the last 12 years or so, and I have never had trouble either gaining weight or losing it. Good nutrition is great for the body no matter if you have health issues or not. But since you are concerned in regards to HIV and you have taken part in higher risk sexual behavior my suggestion would be to have an HIV test performed. Your local ASO has a simple 15min test available.

0	Do planes take sharp turns and fly off into the universe, or have the stars learned to fly? I expect to get teased by asking that question, that's cool.  But I live in Southern Ohio and in the past (almost) 3 years, I've see two relatively bright blue stars at night around 10:00 pm. One just moving along and then abruptly turn and zip off into the cosmos. The other just sat there like a star ... it began to slowly drift to the south and started getting smaller ... then it too just zipped off, with the trail that lasted for an instant.  What's up with that? It was a government plane. They have planes that can be very silent. they are in an octagon shape. they can hover, they have verticle lift-off, and they have weird lights. some people think that they are UFO's
8	Is it weird for an 18 year old guy to go out with a early 20 something girl? Probably not but you see a lot of girls going out with older men and now we are used to it....but you dont see too often a younger man going out with and older woman....if there something weird do tell.....i wanna know what you people think No, I don't think so. I always thought men should go for older, more experienced women. Just don't act like an idiot, and please be mature. Women mature faster than men. My boyfriend is five years older than me and we are about the same level of maturity.
2	how do i know if i have a foreign object in my eye for sure or not? I was at work the other day and felt somthing go in my eye i believe i got it out when i flushed my eye with water there at work but my eye has been irratated ever since constantly watering. I cannot fell anything in my eye so is it possible that i may have a scratch on my eye? and if so what can i do to reduce the soreness? the only sure way to find out is to see an eye doctor.  it's only human nature to rub when things irratate our eyes & if something was in it you may well have scratched it.  if the object is still in your eye you will need an eye doctor to find & remove it.  if the eye is scratched, there are special drops that relieve your pain.
2	I'm having a hard time getting use to my Prozac, are side effects common? I had the same problem when I was first put on it...the first two weeks were hell.

It was awful, but it eventually went away!\n\nKeep your head up!

9	what is your view on immigration? What immigration? Irish who immigrated to America few hundred years ago and kicked the red Indians, or British who immigrated to Australia and Newzealand and killed the natives there, or the new type of immigration which is Africans and Asians coming to Europe and America taking low paid jobs that westerner refuse to do and get treated badly because they are immigrants!!! we are all immigrants! go back hundred years and tell me where did your great grand father came from? Earth belongs to God not to certain group of people. We should fairly compete for a better life, not to support some jobless thugs who hate foreigners!
4	Best laptop for DESIGN and GAMING? I'm looking to get a laptop. I'm a designer, but I'm also a gamer ... so, that being the case, I need a PC. I need a good Video card, and plenty of memory. I'd also like a long battery life. What company and laptop is the best to go with? And what chip is best AMD or Pentium)? What kind of designer are you? Photo, video, cad?\n\nIf you're doing photoshop or video editing, you don't need much of a graphics card, just memory. Well, maybe not. You'll still need the graphics card for the gaming though.\n\nIf you're a cad designer, you will need to get a good workstation graphics card (nVidia QuadroFX Go 1400 is the best for laptops). Unfortunately, it's not half as good as the desktop QuadroFX 4500 or most of the newer gaming graphics card. If you're really going for the high end, you could get a laptop with an ATI Radeon X800 or X1800 and softmod it, but it's pretty risky. The X1800 might not even be softmod-able. However, even without the softmod, it'll still be pretty fast for OpenGL, not to mention much cheaper than the QuadroFX Go 1400.\n\nFor designing, you'll want a LOT of memory. 2 GIGs is usually fine for anything besides extensive video editing.\n\nYou'll also want a dual-core CPU. AMD Turion X2 is fine, as with the newer centrinos. They aren't the fastest, but they'll keep your laptop cool enough to let the maximum power out of your graphics card and memory.\n\nMid-range solution: The best would be the Dell E1705. Configure it with the 2nd fastest dual-core CPU, 2GIG ram, the GeForce Go 7900 GS. You can check Dealnews.com periodically for Dell deals. They usually post a $750 coupon weekly. The complete system will cost you about $1500-1800. This laptop will run almost as fast as the high-end solutions below. It's by far the best bang for the buck.\n\nHigh-end solutions: An Alienware, Dell XPS M1710, or Sager laptop with an nVidia Go 7900 GTX (http://www.powernotebooks.com/category.php?catId=26#id1415). I would avoid the Alienware and Dell XPS setups because they will be at least $1000 more expensive than the Sager model. However, they're usually better built and have better cooling. If you really want to shell out 50% more money for a 20% gain in quality/speed, go for them. But there's no guarentee that you're going to get anything close to what you're paying for.

6	why do they wait to burie the casket until the family leaves the ground? My very first job before getting into radio was a grounds keeper at a local "Memorial Park", as we liked to call it.  I have first hand knowlege on this subject.  Our grave yard was situated on a hillside.  This sometimes meant that we had to actually dig the graves by hand instead of using a backhoe.  Anyway, I hate to say that sometimes the casket does not make a gracefull landing in the vault.  One time we were burrying this man, and his casket was oversized, and his family only ordered a normal size vault(the vault is the cement box that the casket is put into) After the fmily left, we had to take the handles off of the casket to make it fit.  It was a tight fit, but we finally got him in.  One time (i was not working there for this one) A groundskeeper was lowering a casket, he did not wait until the family left the cemetary, and seeing as how the grave was in a hilly area as he lowered the casket, he had to use his foot to guide the casket down.  The family totally flipped out, they thought this guy was jumping up and down on their relitive.  So to answer your question, they usually wait for the family to leave...because accidents can happen.
1	Calculate the total distance in miles the bird travels? The distance between Station Atena and Station Barcena is 90 miles. A train starts from Atena towards Barcena. A bird starts at the same time from Barcena straight towards the moving train. On reaching the train, it instantaneously turns back and returns to Barcena. The bird makes these journeys from Barcena to the train and back to Barcena continuously till the train reaches Barcena. The bird finally returns to Barcena and rests. Calculate the total distance in miles the bird travels in the following two cases:  \n(a) The bird flies at 90 miles per hour and the speed of the train is 60 miles per hour.  \n(b) the bird flies at 60 miles per hour and the speed of the train is 90 miles per hour a) 135 miles\nIt takes the train 1.5 hrs to reach Barcena, so the bird flies 1.5 hrs at 90 mph = 135 miles.\n\nb) 60miles  \nIt takes the train 1 hr to reach Barcena so the bird flies for an hour at 60mph. So it flies 60 miles
5	Rugby - Super 14.....now that we're entering the 2nd year of Super 14? Last year Super 12 changed to Super 14 with the inclusion of 2 new teams; Aussies 'Western Force' & Sth Africas 'Cheetahs'.\n\nDo you think in the near future the Super 14 body will decide to include either the Pacific Islanders (combined team of Samoan, Togan & Fijian players) or any Pacific Island country teams into the competition or not?\n\nTell me waht you think and why...... Good Question!!!\n\nThere is a very good possibility that the SA teams will in the near future not play Super 14 rugby anymore. Reason's being that the sponsors are not happy with the SA teams performinces and the supporters don't support the games any more. Very good posibility that SA teams will play in the Heinecke Cup.\n\nShould this be the case then it will fore sure, leave the door open for other Southern hemisphere teams to join the Super 14
9	Why are the Clintons so highly regarded by the far left when they have been proven to be so corrupt? HELLO? I never understood why certain corrupt politicians are given a free pass to continue on being filthy dirty scum they all are.  Now with that in mind, why are the Clintons being given special treatment by the heads of the DNC when you consider how much damage the Clintons do to the intregity (or lack thereof) to the Democratic Party.   I would think that corrupt politicians would not be welcomed into ANY political party these days.  Does this actually mean that half the people in our country are pathetic idiots and use their butts instead of their brains to think before they vote??\nSHEESH!!!!!! Clinton was just a very likable guy. I liked the guy and even defended him when he cheated. But people who defend him now are just sheep that are defending him only because he is a Dem, nothing more. It is very hippocritical because these same people accuse Bush supporters of the same thing. I also believe that it was Clinton's corruption and lack of integrity that ruined Gore's run for the White House. But overall, I agree, these supporters are very dumb.

3	Why is it warmer at the equator than at the poles? It has something to do with the sun's rays, but i'm not exactly sure. I have a science test 2morrow. Help! the suns rays hit the equator at "90 degrees" perpendicular and the heat is absorbed by the Earth. and the rays hit either poles at low angles therefore bouncing off rather than being absorbed.
7	What is the name of this song?!! You would have to be 30yrs old or older to really know the answer...? The song came out in the late 70's early 80's and it has no real lyrics it is just the sound of people going "Doon dada doon dodo doon dada doon do". I thought is was by Art of noise but I cannot find it by going through their music. I want to put it on my MP3 player but I  can't until I can look it up using its name. The artist is George Kranz, the song is called Din Daa Daa and its found on the Breakin 2- Electric Boogaloo soundtrack
5	Is Ronnie Brewer good or bad for the rockets? his 3-point shooting is not good for the rockets but his defense is really great Brewer will be a valuable addition wherever he ends up because he has a high court I.Q.  and is more mature and well adjusted than many of the other lottery picks mentioned.  This young man is an exception ...he has excellent athleticism and he is one of the most selfless players I have seen on the court...combining solid shooting, amazing court vision for finding his open teammates, and relentless defensive drive...qualities not always found at the NBA level.  Rumor has it, a lot of the other guards projected to go in the top 8 have been avoiding Ronnie in the individual team workouts: likely good advice from agents who do not want to take the chance of seeing their stock fall from a bad showing against this kid who has consistently shown his ability (and capabilites) against anyone who will show up since the pre-draft camp.  Those who think Brewer's shooting will hold him back in the draft are forgetting some important intangibles....this kid has what every coach and GM want in a newly drafted player; natural athleticism combined with high coachability, and a great attitude.  Whatever he is lacking in technique to become a great NBA contributor, can be developed by a good coach.

3	how many concentration camps where there in ww2? the number of camps for the jews in europe plus the # of jews sent there rounded plese : ) By 1944 there were 13 main concentration camps and over 500 satellite camps. These were not solely for Jews though.\n\nIt has been estimated that between 1933 and 1945 a total of 1,600,000 were sent to concentration work camps.  Again not solely Jews.\n\nThis does not refer to extermination camps.\n\nI have given you an excellent web link with lots more detail.  This actual link refers directly to cocentration camps, but the rest of the site might also prove helpful.  It's aimed at school students.

5	What is a good college or nfl pick this week to cover the spread? I would take a look at Louisville under a TD against Rutgers.  There's a lot of talk out there about how great this Rutgers team is, how powerful Ray Rice is, how the defense doesn't give up any points.  And then you look at their schedule.  UNC, ILL, OHIO and Howard as a Non-Conference slate?  Also remember that Navy lost it's starting QB early in their game.  On the flip side, the Petrino knows that he has to win and win big to make up for his team's weak schedule compared to FLA, CAL, TEX & MICH.  The Cardinals have a pretty solid defense and an Offense that is clicking once again with Brohem at the controls.  Petrino puts his foot on the accelerator and doesn't look back.  Louisville, comfortably.

6	Do you get plastic bags or paper bags at the grocery store? Just wondering Jeez, I'm glad you asked that question. I still like the paper bags better than the plastic ones.  Whenever I go grocery shopping, I ask the bagger to load the groceries in double paper bags.Usually they have them but sometimes they don't. I hate the plastic because when you put the groceries in your car, they roll around and right outta the bag and it's hell trying to empty your car out.

Two parts to the answer.\n1) John was 6 months older than Jesus. He was still the first born of his parents, though.\n\n2) John lived in a different area. The babies in the Bethlehem area were targeted - not the whole of Israel.

My girlfriend is Asian. Her family wonders why she dates a white guy, and my family wonders why I am dating an Asian lady.

5	Which receivers should I start? I have 3 open spots.  Who should I start?\n\nTorry Holt vs KC  (Obvioulsy im startin him)\nAndre Johnson @ NYG\nChris Chambers @ CHI\nEric Parker vs CLE I think Johnson is an automatic start, regardless of the Texans' opponent or who's playing QB for them.  He's the top receiver on a team that often falls behind and is forced to throw, and he's been very consistent this year.\n\nI agree with the first post in choosing Parker to start over Chambers.  Chambers has a chance to possibly put up a score when Miami inevitably falls behind and as forced to throw, but Paker should have the steadier day.

Yes, I'm afraid they will pull some other despicable act, but it doesn't matter who has control of the houses at this point, they need to keep us terrorized, so we don't talk about the issues and investigations.

I'm sure if i watched what i ate at breakfast time i would have lost more. So it all depends on how much you are willing to put into it.

0	If a Wasp man had an Italian-American or a Jewish girlfriend would this be an interracial couple? Just wondering, not that race matters, but I have a friend who is your typical WASP American and his girlfriend is Italian-American, I have another friend who is a WASP American who's girlfriend is Jewish. Are they interracial couples or not? to a degree yes they used to be considered so - as the italian gal is probably catholic.  the two religions were considered like to different ethincities.\n\none thing i would warn him about -- generally ethnic familied have lots of traditions and such -- as a WASP he may or may not have them - generally not so.... he will need to know that these family traditions are as important as the family itself.
0	does mormon think catholics are the anticrist? Wow...you folks sure can talk a lot for not knowing much about the LDS church. \n\nHere is the answer from a Mormon. It's not an official view from the LDS Church, but it's a lot closer than the bunk other people have been spouting off. \n\nDo Mormons think Catholics are the Antichrist? \nAbsolutely not! There is absolutely no LDS doctrine that labels ANY specific religion as "the antichrist". LDS doctrine teaches of acceptance and love towards members of other faith. \n\nHowever it is true that the LDS church makes the claim of being Christ's official church. That doesn't leave room for the other Christian denominations being "official" too. That doesn't mean that Mormons believe others to be "evil" or "antichrists" simply based on being a Catholic for instance.

8	Why do you black guys always have to talk about race in regards to every thing? All I see is a bunch of racist questions from you black guys. What are you trying to prove? All you prove to me is you are more racist than any white people I know. Black people talk about us people being racists because they use that as an excuse not to move up in life, if you notice, a lot of them do not have an education, and they are part of gangs and stuff, and they have nothing good to offer to society, and that's the truth, there are counted black people who are doing something positive towards society and the world, but even some of them have done something negative in their past. They spend more time talking about others being racist against them, but instead of talking, they should be in a class room, learning history, and getting and education.

I opted to have it cut out, and yes, it hurt badly for about a week.
9	What is The Law of Domain? I know it's associated to Chicago's O'hare wanting to remove a cementary to have a new run way. I believe you are asking about the legal concept of Eminent Domain:  \n\nEminent domain (US), compulsory purchase (United Kingdom, New Zealand), compulsory acquisition (Australia) or expropriation (Canada, South Africa) in common law legal systems is the lawful power of the state to expropriate private property without the owner's consent, either for its own use or on behalf of a third party. The term eminent domain is used primarily in the United States, where the term was derived in the mid-19th century from a legal treatise written by the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius in 1625. The term compulsory purchase, also originating in the mid-19th Century, is used primarily in England and Wales, and other jurisdictions that follow the principles of English law. Originally, the power of eminent domain was assumed to arise from natural law as an inherent power of the sovereign.\n\nGovernments most commonly use the power of eminent domain when the acquisition of real property is necessary for the completion of a public project such as a road, and the owner of the required property is unwilling to negotiate a price for its sale. In many jurisdictions the power of eminent domain is tempered with a right that just compensation be made for the appropriation.\n\nSome coined the term expropriation to refer to "appropriation" under eminent domain law, and may especially be used with regard to cases where no compensation is made for the confiscated property. Examples include the 1960 Cuban expropriation of property held by U.S. citizens, following a breakdown in economic and diplomatic relations between the Eisenhower Administration and the Cuban government under Fidel Castro. U.S. nationals and corporations held vast amounts of Cuba's prime real-estate. Cuban authorities offered just compensation for US properties, as they had successfully done for Spanish, British and French properties when they nationalized private property in Cuba, for the common good. However, U.S. authorities refused, adhering to the notion that those properties are still privately owned by U.S. interests forty five years later. This is in direct contrast with recent rulings by the US Supreme Court which allows a corporation to displace a private citizen from his/her realty, if the corporate development is considered to be in the best interest of the municipality.\n\nThe term "condemnation" is used to describe the act of a government exercising its authority of eminent domain. It is not to be confused with the term of the same name that describes the legal process whereby real property, generally a building, is deemed legally unfit for habitation due to its physical defects. Condemnation via eminent domain indicates the government is taking the property; usually, the only thing that remains to be decided is the amount of just compensation. Condemnation of buildings on grounds of health and safety hazards or gross zoning violation usually does not deprive the owner of the property condemned but requires the owner to rectify the offending situation.\n\nThe exercise of eminent domain is not limited merely to real property. Governments may also condemn the value in a contract such as a franchise agreement (which is why many franchise agreements will stipulate that in condemnation proceedings, the franchise itself has no value).

8	IF GOD had gave you a change to pick to be a man or woman , would you stay the same? Somehow, as rare as I think it is, I would find myself battling between sexes. I don't know why, but there is this power, strenght, and easy going life that men SOMETIMES follow, while women have this suffering,painful,fragile, yet loving life SOMETIMES. The women are argumentative, mentally strong, physically active just as the men are, and they are much more fragile with their hearts, and their soul is much more heavier. They suffer while giving birth to another beautiful human life, and they live complications with their periods, until menopause hits their stage of life.Yet they are intelligent creautures who know what they want,dream,desire,and are extremely passionate about. A mans heart, can carry so much, they can be physically hurt and mentally hurt, but yet, hard to define which of them both will affect them more... They are just so in charge of situations, much more at risk than women, and somehow they have challenges to meet, but never fail to obtain what they so majestically propose to themselves! I know women have been challenging and successfull throughout their lives too, but there are those little painful things that make me want to change into the opposite sex... Men are strong too, but yet, there is this darkness in them that make me want to have second thoughts about changing from my own opposite sex....I don't know which change I would pick..but I do know this...GOD created us a certain way, and that is how we have to live accepting for the rest of our lives...it is no mistake, since he KNOWS where our paths lead! with this said, go through the path that has never been touched...AND leave a trail!
4	my clock changes time on task bar once every few days? it never did it til i put in windows defender     maybe that will help some Could you be a little more specific? How does it change exactly? If it's resetting every time you shut the computer off then citalopraming has got it right, you need a new cmos battery, which is just a coin cell battery on the motherboard that supplies a bit of power to keep the clock right and the bios settings intact while the computer is off. If it's just changing by a few minutes every few days that might mean that the clock on your motherboard is a bit fast or slow, and every week or so the clock automatically syncs itself with an internet time server, and changes back to the correct time.

I'm wondering if there is a way to scan business cards (thru a scanner) and upload the result into Outlook contacts menu to populate those fields instead of having to manually enter those info. 1. After you scan the card, use some good ocr software to mine the text off the pic\n2. export the contact of your outlook to a file using commas separate value(csv) format\n3. open the csv file, it will be like a normal excel spreadsheet, copy and paste the mined text to the relevant column.\n4. proofready the entries, save the excel spreadsheet as csv format, import it back to outlook as contact.\nHope this helps.

6	How was buying a home for you?  How was acquiring a mortgage?  I am going to be purchasing one soon...? I'm buying a small starter house with my sister.\nMy credit is in the mid 700s and my sister has only had one credit card in her name (paying off monthly).\nWe have about $15k in savings.\nI work part time, she works full time but only $7-8 an hour.\nI'm fairly certain the payment will be less than the $555 rent I am paying now by myself, plus we will be gaining equity.\n\nHow was your experience purchasing a home?\nI have a credit union, will rates be cheaper there?\nWhat and how much fees will be involved?  Inspector?  I will not have a buying broker, but they are selling thru a realtor.  Do I need a lawyer?\n\nPlease let me know the good and bad things you have encountered while buying your home.  Thanks! The first home is the most challenging...so many questions.  But so much fun!\n\nIf the seller is using a broker, you should as well.  The seller is paying a set percentage to the agent (usually 5%-7%) of the sales price which gets split between the agents.  Your agent should be with a different agency to prevent conflicts of interest (there are never supposed to be conflicts, based on Realtor ethics codes enforced by the National Association of Realtors, but it's always better to be safe).  Your agent won't cost you a dime, and you'll have the benefit of representation.\n\nAn attorney (or title company, depending on your state) conducts the closing in all non-cash closings.  Don't get too anxious about specific attorneys, as long as they are reputable, they should be fine.  You could always pick a seperate one from the seller, but it isn't always necessary.\n\nYour fees will depend greatly on your shopping ability.  I suggest printing a copy of your credit report and carry it with you until you find a bank/mortgage company/credit union you are satisfied with.\nAsk questions like what is the APR you are offering.  The APR takes into account all points (a point is equal to 1% of the loan), fees, junk fees, origination fees, and the interest rate.  **Comparing APRs will allow you to compare apples to apples**  Comparing interest rates alone forces you to compare apples to oranges, bannanas, and even watermelons!\n\n**Check with your newly aquired realty agent, or the lenders that you are shopping with, on the availability of 1st time homebuyer incentives....there are litterally hundreds available that will reduce your down payment, APRs, points required, etc.***\n\nThis should be a lot of fun!  Remember that it is OK to get emotional regarding the house, but wait until you have closed and have the keys in your hand.  Keep emotion out of the shopping and financing portion of the process.\n\nHave a great time in your new home!  Best of luck.
8	my grandmother walked in on me and my boyfriend having sex 2 days ago. she refuses to talk to me. what do i do i am 22 years old. i work full time and go to school. my parents thought it would be cheaper if i lived at home.., well the day b4 yesterday nobody was home (or so i thought,) so my boyfriend and i decided to do a little quickie. i got a little vocal when he had me on all 4's (i was facing the door) suddenly my door flung open and there i was in this compromising position looking my grandma dead in the eyes.i cannot begin 2 xplain how embarrassed i am. my grandma adored me up until that moment. Today (sunday) we had easter dinner here at my parents house. my grandma did not even look at me. i tried to tell her that i am sorry and she wont listen. my parents are totally confused bcuz they have no idea what is going on... my boyfriend was invited to dinner but was too embarrassed to show up. how in the world do i get my grandma to adore me again? this is very serious. i really need advice!!! Sounds like your grandmother is a very old-fashioned.  O.K. so that's not it at all.  She is probably upset because your not the innocent little girl you used to be. I can say this... You must reach her no matter what it takes. Tell her that you love her but, if she had knocked, this would not be an issue,   that it breaks your heart that she won't even talk to you about it.  This could cause her to worry, or stew, herself into a heart attack or a stroke. So do what ever it takes.  I'm feeling grandma's pain....I am one too.

9	Hard earned tax money well spent? True story. A few months ago I was hospitalized for a kidney infection. I had no health insurance at the time, my work does not cover me. I was told by the hospital that I could apply for medical aid to help pay the bill. I recieved a phone call just yesterday informing me that I was declined any aid. What they told me was appalling, the reason I could not get any aid was because I'm not a drug addict or an alcoholic, unmarried mother with two or more kids, a refugee, and yes an illegal alien!! I have been working since I was 15 and paying taxes ever since, I never applied for any kind of government aid in my life, this one time that I would have really needed it, the government slapped me in the face. Do you think it is better I renounce my citizenship? The medical claims office informed me illegals get all kinds of aid, no questions asked. Do you think this is fair? I have been contact my local and state government to complain, I recomend it to all legal tax payers out there I worked for many years in community mental health and I know exactly what you are talking about with regard to services.  The problem here is that liberals have infiltrated the offices that supply those services and routinely reject people who aren't pawns in their plans to overthrow the government by bankrupting the social services systems.  That means no welfare for you if you are white, not an addict, not an illegal, not a felon etc.\n\nYou need to understand something.  Although this is the rule, not the exception in most major metropolitan areas, it is also highly illegal.  What you need to do is get a lawyer (one's who specialize in this are a booming business in these areas) and serve them with a letter of intent to sue.  This  will cause them to immediately approve your aid (at least it used to work 100% of the time in Cook County, where I worked)  These people know that what they are doing is illegal and they definitely don't want to be sued as that would most likely result in alot of people being fired and setting back the marxist revolution or whatever.  None of that is your problem.  The situation exists because all your idiot neighbors vote irresponsibly and don't pay attention to these issues.  You can't change it and shouldn't even try.  Instead, you need to focus on your own health and well being and getting what you need from the system.
9	what is the maximum amount of criminal charges you can recieve at once? charges occurring in iowa but a nonspecific question becuase i had not heard this before. hoping to get some decent criminal law type input. Some crimes merge (conspiracy to commit crime is not longer charged when you commit crime) and some dont' (attempt to commit and the actual crime can be charged as once. So you can be charged w/ all the non merging offenses, lower offenses, and higher offenses, as well as federal offenses. There is no limit to how many crimes you can be charged with. You could be charged w/ committing crimes in all 50 states (if they happened in the states)  plus federal crimes. People have been charged w/ hundred of offenses at once (child porn rings, etc)

Bad for her, even if you don't like her you should have some basic human decency.\n\nIt's bad for him because he's a cheater and cheapening himself & the two of you.\n\nIt's bad for you because you're the other woman, you're a cheater along with him. & you could never trust him.

Do you really want to be with someone like that? Quite frankly you don't have much integrity if you're wiling to be in this situation either. So why would he want to be with you? Or maybe you're both a-holes & you deserve each other...\n\nSorry I get angry about infidelity. It's wrong. It's cowardly. Tell him if he doesn't love his girlfriend & wants to be with you then grow a set of balls & dump her BEFORE he starts seeing you. That's the proper way to do it, for those of us who have a conscience.\n\nGood luck.\n\nThis attack of conscience & morals has been brought to you by amp, girl campaigning for an honest tomorrow!...
2	How does anyone feel about Jenny Craig verses Weight Watchers? Do these programs really work, Im considering, Weight Watchers is much better because in the long run, you learn an entire new way of cooking to maintain your weight.  With Jenny Craig, you have to buy their expensive meals and learn nothing about nutrition.

8	Do Chicks like to get played on? It seems they do, maybe it's a thrill to them not knowing if the guy will call back or not after she let him hit it.\n\nhttp://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-Nr4iWwE.f6MWSl0AAmWri2pV9rCIp6CCpNR3?p=30 My goodness!!!  For someone who bemoans 'chicks rights' & says things like 'there are no more virgins' like it's the end of the world.  You sure do love the new system, & how it could work for you. \n\nMost girls that I know who have one night stands are not interested in it going beyond that.  They don't want the guy to call them & in fact go to great lengths to avoid getting called, giving him fake digits & even just flat out saying, 'listen I'm not interested in anything else and this isn't going anywhere beyond tonight.'\n\nI don't think it's right, but hey it's not my place to judge them for what they do.\n\n Stop painting a picture of women like we are all crazy out to get men.  (I will admit there are some crazies out there, Hey they even scare me!  But not all of us are like that!  And I've had more bad experiences with Crazy men out to get me then with crazy women!)

6	how to make info commercials? For making my own video I use a digital video camera. A Canon GL3 to be exact. After planing a script to convey the desired message I shoot the video. Using a firewire IEEE connection between the camera and computer, I download the recording using Ulead MediaStudio Pro (http://www.ulead.com/) software. You can add sound from one of many "Royalty Free" music download sites (http://www.royalty-free.tv/) and otherwise edit the video to create thousands of effects. Once it's all to my liking I save it. If you are going to stream the video online you will want to compress the video to a WMV (windows media video) to make it smaller and adjust the bit rate to help the Internet stream. You can get the Windows Media Encoder free at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx\n\nThen you can run your commercial on any of a thousand websites who provide video advertising. Here's a sample of one of my commercials: \n\nhttp://www.azonlinemarketing.com/online-marketing-video.php\n\nHope that helps a bit.

3	how to design a 10 week lesson plan to teach english to foreign students? I need more information.\nWho are your students?  That is, what level of English do they have now? (none, some, quite good but need help with vocabulary and accents?)\nFor what purpose are you teaching?  To pass an exam?  For daily life (survival skills), for work vocabulary?\nWhat age are your students?  Children, adolescents and adults all learn differently and have different preferences in teachers.  Children and adolescents like to have 'steath' learning--that is, they do not perceive what they are doing as work.  Young adults and adults are more straight forward and generally prefer some homework for example.\nOnce you know the needs of your learners, you can easily plan a course of 10 weeks that suits their needs.
9	14 y/o stalker, part 2? Thanks for all the wonderfull answers and support for my first question about this! \nI was wondering if anyone thought that by filing a police report I would be making the situation worse? I'm a little afraid that his family or friends will get involved if we go to the police. I don't want to get anything else started, or make things worse for my daughter. I just want to make this go away. Has anyone else had a problem with a stalker before? If so, how did you handle it? I checked out your previous question and WOW!  I would say you definitely have a problem.  I know how emotional and vindictive teens can be so I completely understand your dilemma.  When it comes to your children's safety, I would rather err on the side of caution!  Think of all the hormones and testosterone this young man has running through his system...  if you were to only attack this situation half heartedly, you run the risk of simply embarrassing him and further enraging his already emotional state.  Obviously if he is stalking your daughter, he has little to no self control.  Think of a pissed off teen boy catching your daughter in a situation where she is alone or off guard.(walking home from school, on her way to a friends house...)  What is he capable of?  I would rather you never find out!  I would certainly go to the police and talk to someone involved in juvenile services.  His behavior is NOT normal and should be investigated.  It is entirely possible he needs a mental health eval and would benefit from some professional help.  Good Luck and God bless!

1	why is the sky blue and the grass green? i accually know whay the grass is green because of the clorifil it just sounded cool Grass is green because they contain a pigment\nknown as chlorophyll. The chlorophyll is used in the process of photosynthesis where a plant produces sugar in the presence of sunlight.\n\nBLUE SKY:  A clear cloudless day-time sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light.

2	What does phototoxic mean? referring to grapefruit essential oil:\n\nSafety Information: Phototoxic.  Do not use if the area of application will be exposed to sunlight for 24 hours due to its phototoxicity\n\nObviously I can see that it will have a reaction with the sunlight, but what exactly will happen?  What kind of toxins are produced? A phototoxic substance is a chemical compound which becomes toxic only when exposed to light.\n\nPhototoxicity is a phenomenon known in live-cell live cell fluorescence microscopy, where illuminating a fluorescent molecule (the fluorescently active site is called a fluorophore) causes the selective death of the cells expressing it. While not completely understood, it seems to be clear that the main cause for phototoxicity is the formation of oxygen radicals due to non-radiative energy transfer.\n\nTypically in fluorescence, photons of a certain wavelength excite electrons of the illuminated fluorophore to higher energy states. When these excited electrons return to a lower energy state, they emit a photon with a lower energy level thus causing the emission of light of a longer wavelength. This principle of fluorescence is also known as Stokes shift.\n\nUnfortunately for microscopists, in many cases some of the energy is not used for this radiative energy transfer but is transferred to oxygen causing the formation of oxygen radicals. These radicals are highly toxic to living cells, sometimes killing cells in seconds.\n\nPhototoxicity in live cells depends strongly on the kind of fluorescent molecule used. The isolation and characterization of fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) has provided biologists with fluorochromes which show a much weaker phototoxic effect compared to most smaller chemically synthesized fluorescent molecules such as FITC or rhodamine. Still, the energy level of excitation light as well as the duration of illumination must be minimized to ensure long-term survival of living cells during fluorescent imaging.\n\n\n\n# May cause a skin reaction such as burning, irritation, or pigment change upon exposure to ultra-violet light (sunlight, tanning lights).\nwww.simplers.com/herbal/definition.htm\n\n# sun exposure causes skin pigmentation\nwww.aworldofaromatherapy.com/aromatherapy-glossary.htm\n\n# increases the sensitivity of the skin to sunlight and ultraviolet radiation to the point of toxicity\nwww.lovingscents.com/Glossary.htm

4	What program made this? Plz help!? http://mcrfan.com/multimedia/colorbars.htm\nWhat program can do that (And if it is Adobe Photoshp,then im gonna slap myself!)? Start slapping. It's Photoshop. \n\nI can tell because it's a PNG. When I opened it in Fireworks, which is a PNG editing program, it shows a single bitmap image in the background layer -- which is exactly how Photoshop saves a PNG after you "flatten" the image (merge all the layers into one) -- and since this is a composite image made from several images, that pretty much seals it.\n\nAnother dead giveaway is the way the masks were applied to the backgrounds of each individual (that is, the background colors of each image were "knocked out", or masked). \n\nIt takes a pretty good image editing program to make masks as good as the ones used here, even if the subject is against a black background; in fact, it actually looks like these were made using clipping paths, which is a dead giveaway that Photoshop was the tool used.\n\nSo, if I was to guess how these were made:\n\n1. Each band member's individual photo was turned into a clipping path, to knock out the background.\n\n2. Each was then placed on a the final canvas and scaled to fit.\n\n3. Each member was then overlaid with a 20% opacity solid color, with a blend from the color it was starting at to the color it was matched against. That was probably done with a plug-in.\n\n4. The whole thing was flattened and shipped out to PNG, probably in ImageReady.

Yet he continues to behave in the manner i find degrading to me...i get tired of the whispers...form other women..they judge our relationship because of his actions and still he claims it is innocent and wants to marry me to prove his love for me....DOES HE THINK I AM REALLY STUPID OR SHOULD I GIVE HIM A DOSE OF HIS OWN MEDICINE?

They are the only ones helping me out with  money and stuff but still.. N-E ways my problem is none of his friends or family will help us out with money... what should i do??? Let him stew in jail.  He got into trouble and you aren't responsible to get him out of it.  What if you did bail him out and he skipped or didn't show up for court??  You would lose whatever you put up for bail.  Dump him, he's not worth the trouble.  He's just been using you and your family up to now and will take advantage of you more if you don't put a stop to it now.\n\nI suggest you attend a Bible believing church and find a nice guy who will treat you right.  Most of the guys there won't be winding up in jail and you just might find the prince you have been looking for all your life.

8	I recently met my birth mother? for the first time and I'm not sure how much to believe... She kept contradicting herself as the meeting progressed.  So I'm asking this question since I'm not sure if she was honest with me. She told me that my biological father is Italian(but she couldnt remember his name). I dont recall ever having met or seen a person of Italian descent that has naturally red hair.  Is is possible and I havent seen it or what? My adopted family thinks she's just lying to me. Wow, it has to be so interesting to find out about family, especially since they don't feel like family. However in response to your question about the honesty, she may not be 100% sure who your dad is.  But if she is saying that he is a red headed Italian, that is totally possible, and he is most likely from Northern Italy.\n\nHere is a clip from a study done on the decent of Italians...  \n\n. . . we should not neglect the researches of Woltmann (1905). Woltmann studied portrait paintings, busts and written descriptions, to ascertain the physical features of the great men of the Italian Renaissance. He revealed that many of the individuals in question, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Tasso, Galileo, etc., were of Germanic descent, and that they possessed Nordic racial characteristics. The results of his investigations, were as follows: of the 125 men whose eye colour could be discerned, 102 had blue, blue-grey or blue-green eyes; 18 had brown or brown-grey eyes; and 5 had eyes of mixed pigmentation. Of the 108 men whose hair colour could be accurately determined, 68 had blond or red hair; 26 had brown hair; and 14 had black hair. [Woltmann (1905) 143-144.] Woltmann also discovered that most of the noble families who ruled over much of Northern Italy, produced blond individuals throughout their generations. Such families as the d’Este of Ferrara, the Bentivoglia of Bologna and the Sforza of Milan, were all largely blond-haired and blue-eyed. [Woltmann (1905) 42-49.]

6	why is vitamin b good for your health? (m)\n\nThe B Vitamins\nThere's more than one B vitamin. Here's the list: B1, B2, B6, B12, niacin, folic acid, biotin, and pantothenic acid. Whew - that's quite a group! \n\nThe B vitamins are important in metabolic (say: meh-tuh-bah-lik) activity - this means that they help make energy and set it free when your body needs it. So the next time you're running to third base, thank those B vitamins. This group of vitamins is also involved in making red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout your body. Every part of your body needs oxygen to work properly, so these B vitamins have a big job. \n\nWhich foods are rich in vitamin B?\n\nwhole grains, such as wheat and oats \nfish and seafood \npoultry and meats \neggs \ndairy products, like milk and yogurt \nleafy green vegetables \nbeans and peas \ncitrus fruits, such as oranges
2	at what point can a person overdose on vitamin B6 and what are the effects of an overdose? i have cancer and the chemotherapy I'm on causes neuropathy. my oncologist has advised me to take 100mg ofvitamin B6, but this is not alleviating the symptoms. High doses of Vitamin B6 (300 milligrams or more per day) for long periods of time (greater than 6 months) in a few people has caused peripheral neuropathy.\n\n100 mg/day is considered safe.  I do not know why your doctor is recommending B6 for the treatment of your chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.  I just did a 'quick' search of Pubmed (where the world's medical research can be reviewed) and found several studies showing the supplement Acetyl-L-Carnitine may be effective for the treatment of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathies.  This might be a better 'bet' than B6.\n\nYou can read these studies by going to Pubmed (enter 'entrez pubmed' in your search engine).  In the search window of Pubmed enter: 'chemotherapy peripheral neuropathy Acetyl-L-Carnitine'.  You may want to share these studies with your doctor.\n\nBest wishes and good luck.

There are a set number of slots set aside each year for prior military, as well as Non Prior Service.  \n\nOCS/OTS is NOT a part of college campuses.. that is ROTC, a completely different way to Commission as an officer.

6	how to calculate risks for investments? (Beta, covariance, systematic vs unsystematic risk, etc...). Risk might be equated to uncertainty: uncertainty about achieving your investing goals. Usually, proffesional aproximmate uncertainty with standard deviation.\nbasically that's all behind risk perception.\nNow, covariance is a measure about how returns on one assets might be relate to ohters'. In order to calculate the standard deviation of a portolio , you need a covariance matrix:\nse = sqrt( X'CX) where se is standard deviation of the return, sqrt stands for square root, X is a vector of portfolio holdings and C is a covariance matrix.\nBeta is the regression coefficient of one asset's returns with respect to the market returns. It an easy and dirty way to approximate the std deviation of given asset. However, its not much more difficult to express assets returns as a linear function of several factors. That is called multivariate analysis or, in financial jargon, APT (arbitrage pricing theory). \nIf the returns are expressed as linear combinations of factors and F is factor weighting matrix (entries being securities and factors), C can be calculated as \nC=F'M f where M is the factor covariance matrix.\n\nnow, we have been talking about absolute risk. What is relevant, however is risk relative to goal (benchmark) for doing that you have to measure tracking error, which is de std dev of the differences in return between the benchmark and the portfolio.\nSystematic risk is the risk that can be avoided by diversifiing de portfolio. Unsystematic risk is the risk that is inherent to the underlying market

3	describe the relationship between guidance and curriculum? Well, if you are lucky, a guidance counselor is knowledgeable about the entire curriculum of the school, and can advise you as to the best way to meet your educational goals.\n\nIf you are lucky.  \n\nOtherwise, they are control freaks who have to sign off on your class selections and are responsible for knowing what you can and cannot take, which is also available in the college catalog.  In this case, they are just dark forces to be appeased in your goal of getting the class schedule you want.

2	If I have a family history of liver problems, what are my chances of hanving one when I am older? My uncle on my dad's side died of liver cancer, along with my dad's aunt. My uncle was in a serious car accident when I was young, and had to take painkillers for quite some time. The doctors believe that that was the cause of the cancer. I'm not sure of the reason why my aunt got it, but she was not an alcholic or anything. If I partake in recreational drug use [morphine, soma, coke, ecstasy, valium, mushrooms] and drink about a 12 pack a week, what are my chances of devloping liver problems later on? For real? Even without the family history I'd say your chances are pretty good!

1	what the updates on the columbia river regrading to salmon and the hydroelectricity? the Salmon Which Columbia river? The fact is using hydroelectricity is a wonderful resource, until you think about the fish. Salmon are migratory species which means they pass through rivers on their way to coastal feeding grounds and back to spawn. \nThis means that great big hydroelectric dams on the river stop the salmon from moving around and become trapped.\n\nBasically the fish stocks of salmon are going to be depleted from over fishing and dams soon anyway, so enjoy your fish while you got it. Its the tragedy of the commons.

2	How do you take care of an injured knee? Ice or heat? I was on top of a five foot ladder when it tipped over and I feel on top of it. I landed my knees and elbows on top of the ladder. This happened two days ago and some bruises are just now appearing. I'm sore all over and I can't put any weight on my right knee because it feels like it will give out from under me. How should I take care of this?\n \nThank you \nDEE Oh OWIE! That sounds awful! \n\nIf it's been two days, and you've seen no improvement, you probably need to have it looked at.\n\nI've suffered multiple knee injuries & surgries, and my doc always tells me to alternate ice and heat every 15-20 minutes for an hour, then take a break. (Say an hour or so...) Also, you need to be taking an anti inflammatory, such as Ibuprofin (Advil).\n\nI hope you feel better!
2	What is the best type of life insurance for a single mom, trying to plan for the future care of a young child? I am a 21 year old mother of one (2 year old) and am seeking life insurance, to reassure myself that my son will be taken care of should anything happen to me. Life insurance won't take care of a kid.  A caring adult will.  What would a 2 year old do with $100,000?
8	Can a man love a woman too much? I mean like, why do woman always seem to run away? And not tell what they feel whyle it is still possible to work on it? That's what they always seem to do, they start doubting but don't talk about it, untill it's too late and they're breaking up. They always say I love them too much. I've had many but want only one. Personally, it seems that if a woman does that, she's not the one for you.  If you find someone that loves you, she won't leave you with an excuse that you loved her too much.  That's just ridiculous.  When you find that special someone, she will love you just as much as you love her. And the more you love her, the happier you both will be.  So don't give up, keep looking, and you'll find her.  And don't be afraid to put yourself out there, cuz someone will love you for who you are.
6	what were some ancient japanese games? Go is probably the oldest board games in Japan. It originated in China, and people still play it today. In fact, I think Yahoo may have a version of it in its online games. Its a very strategic game, and there's also an anime about it called Hikaru no Go which is partly responsible for comeback in popularity. Shogi is another ancient board game that's much like chess. The link below has a lot of information on Go. I hope that's useful to you ^_^
4	what is the website????? what is the full website of superproxy? ::Super Proxy System (SPS)::\n\nSuper Proxy System is the combination of a proxyserver and a mailserver. \n\nIn addition to relaying the request and response between the user client and remote server, proxyserver also provides some special functions. For example, it helps fill in the form appearing on the webpage. This will release the user from inputing the data every time when browsing some websites such as New York Times(www.nytimes.com). And all kinds of filters can be included if the user wants so that such annoyances as cookies, pop-up windows and javascript can be removed, which will protect your provicy when you surf the internet.\n\nA special mailserver is built together with proxyserver, which is necessary in some cases where a confirmation email should be replied when registering the account in a form.\n\nSuper Proxy System makes your web surfing easy and secure.\n\nSuper Proxy System can be run in a local area network or individually.\n\nFor more info, go to http://www.scs.cs.nyu.edu/webbug/

9	How has affirmative action effected ethics? I'm currently doing a report on the impact of affirmative action in the U.S.  The one plateau I'm stuck on right now is how exactly has affirmative action effected ethics, not "how do ethics effect affirmative action" but "How does affirmative action effect ethics" Affirmative action is legalized discrimination.  By giving "minority" persons an unearned edge, affirmative action suggests that a "minority" person is less capable than a "non-minority" person.  By its nature, then, affirmative action is unethical.  It not only implies inferiority of "minorities", but it also forces people in authority to make unethical decisions.

1	Pendulums and acceleration due to gravity? A pendulum has a period of .600 sec at the equator.  The pendulum is moved to another place on Earth and the period is now .598 sec.  Find the acceleration due to gravity at this location.\n\nOk, I know the equation for the period, BUT to find g, you also need to know the length, which isn't given.\n\nTherefore, how am I supposed to find g?  Thanks! From above person.\n\nT = 2*pi*(sqr rt. of L/g)\n\nso apply it twice and get two equations with two unknowns. The unknowns being L and g. Assuming that g is 9.80 at the equator.\n\nAt the equator:\n\n0.600 = 2 * pi * (sqrt (L/9.80))\n\nYou can actually just solve that for L.\n\nAt the other location\n\n0.598 = 2 * pi * (sqrt (L/g)) using the L from above.

4	How to set up a wiFi connecton? How to set up a wifi connection on my home PC so that I can browse internet from my PSP from the other room, over the wifi? First of all, a wireless home network make no sense if you are using a dial-up modem. You should have either a DSL or Cable modem. If so, all you need is a wireless router like the Linksys WRT54G.\nThe router have to be connected to the modem and the PC can be connected to the router either wired or wireless. For indoor use wireless connection can cover distances up to 50 yards, depending on the environment (e.g. walls a.s.o.).\nI'm not familiar with the PSP, so i don't know if it already has a built in wireless card. If not, you have to get one that corresponds with the 802.11b (11Mbit) or 802.11g (54Mbit) specifications.\n\nLinksys wireless router (i'm using this router (v1.1) for 2 years now without any problems, but it seems the new v5 causes some trouble)\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833124010\n\nA considerable alternative is the D-Link DI-524 or DI-624\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833127143\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833127028

1	why does the clock get set back 1 second every few years once? LEAP SECONDS\nCivil time is occasionally adjusted by one second increments to ensure that the difference between a uniform time scale defined by atomic clocks does not differ from the Earth's rotational time by more than 0.9 seconds. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), an atomic time, is the basis for civil time. \nHistorically, the second was defined in terms of the rotation of the Earth as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day.  In 1956, the International Committee for Weights and Measures, under the authority given it by the Tenth General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1954, defined the second in terms of the period of revolution of the Earth around the Sun for a particular epoch, because by then it had become recognized that the Earth's rotation was not sufficiently uniform as a standard of time.  The Earth's motion was described in Newcomb's Tables of the Sun, which provides a formula for the motion of the Sun at the epoch 1900 based on astronomical observations made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  The ephemeris second thus defined is \n\nFor more click the source link.

Have any suggestions. Take your time and don't rush this relationship.  Your still young and you need to make sure you are jumping into a situation that won't allow you to continue to grow and be happy in your life.  A man that old with kids has a very settled and projected life.  You have to be sure this is really a life that you want to take on because kids and his life style are big responsibilities.

0	Why do so many people use apostrophies when they are not necessary? For example, SUVs is correct.  Not SUV's.  Also, "it's" means "it is."  The possessive form is "its." I agree with you 100%.  But dollhaus is correct about SUV's - I remember learning it that way in the 1980s.  Also for numbers - 80's and 90's, as well as 80s and 90s, have both been considered correct at one time or another.  But what really irritates me the most are the apostrophe's used for plural's.  That just looks incredibly ignorant!  It gets confusing, too, when people use them for their plurals but not their possessives.  The boy's played with the dogs toy's today.  This book is hers'.  I knew someone who did this a lot.  I just hate reading things like that, because I usually end up having to read it a couple of times to make sure I understood it correctly.  \n\nI had a manager one time who completely understood - he compared it to someone who was musically inclined hearing a note that was out of tune.  A grammatical error stands out to some people the way a sour note stands out to others.  I am definitely one of the former.  Not to say that I don't make errors myself, but I try to correct them as I go.  A lot of people just don't care to make the effort.\n\nAnother thing that really irritated me - on one of my son's computer games, it uses it's instead of its.  These games are supposed to be designed to teach children, not promote ignorance!

9	Prayer in the Legislature? The Nebraska Legislature opens every session with a prayer.  They have a different preacher do this every day.  One day last week the preacher included in the prayer that legislators are guided to vote against abortion.  He mentioned the millions of, "murders," done in that way.  He also asked God that they not allow evolution taught in public schools.  Some senators were outraged.  My qestion doesn't concern your stand on abortion or evolution.  The question is:  was this appropriate behavior?  To help you in your answer, there are certain agreements made by the deliverer of this prayer.  He broke them.  Should he have been stoped in the middle of it? I don't think he should have been stopped in the middle but I do think he shouldn't be invited back.

0	If I have faith in something, does that mean I'm right?  What importance or effect does faith carry? It depends on what you are putting your faith in. If you are putting your faith in a chair that you know is broken to support you weight and hold you up so you dn't fall, then you may not be right to put your faith in that chair. If you are putting faith in your brakes to stop your car, and you know that your brakes are working great, then you may be right. \n\nDo we only put your faith into things that you know, I think you should always make an effort to put faith in things with consideration of the thing or person you are putting your faith in.\n\nIf we are talking about putting faith in God to save your soul, then it may depend on what god you are talking about. It depends on what god has said regarding faith. If you are hindu, what does god say about faith. If you are Muslim what does it say... and so on... \n\nIf you are going to put faith (hope, trust, love,) into something it shouldn't be done blindly... It should be done with the utmost care and consideration.\nDon't get me wrong there are somethings that can not be tested, tried, etc... so you have to go on your gut feelings, but somethings can be.\n\nI have faith that Jesus died for my sins, and he died and rose aging from the dead.. Is this something I can prove??? I can look at history, and things of that nature, come to a conclusion to support my willingness to put faith in what I am reading in the bible is truth, and this gives me the assurance that putting faith in Jesus is good. I can look at history, the earth, humans... so it really depends on what you are putting your faith in and why.

6	How much does a mailing / email list for a specific demographic in a specific CA zip code cost? Figure 8 to 15 cents per name, depending on the specifics for the list. Remember many list suppliers have a minimum order, usually 5,000 names. \n\nI usually ballpark about $1 per mailpiece "in the mail" including list, printing, postage, lettershop for a standard letter or flyer. \n\nTwo things:\n\n1) if it's basic consumers at home with a certain income, zip code etc, try www.infousa.com\n\n2) if it's a real niche, like old ladies who are into crochet, then go to a big city library and ask for the SRDS - Standard Rate and Data Service Direct Mail list guide.  Or you can buy it online but it's not cheap. \n\nAlso, this is a newbie question... be careful in Direct Mail, it's very powerful if you do it right but if you get even one element wrong your whole mailing is worthless. It's not a media that's beginner-friendly (it's easy to do, but hard to succeed)\n\nI strongly recommend you get a copy of "Magnetic Marketing" which is the classic work in this area - it's by Dan Kennedy available at www.dankennedy.com.  And no, I'm not getting paid for that. \n\nGood luck,\nScott

I have even tried emailing Adam Buxton, but got no reply! I can think of two ways. Burn the podcast to cd then rip it as an mp3. Then use an audio editor to see the mp3 as a waveform and then find the relevant part and cut around it. Finally, extract the clip as an mp3 using the program you've used to edit it.\n\nAnother method is to record it direct from radio onto a pc as an mp3 then follow the same process.\n\nI've not heard their podcast but I loved their show from years back.

5	Why is the size of a football pitch as it is when and how was it determined? Not all pitches are the same size.\n\nA football pitch (let's not call it soccer) must be between 100 yards (90m) and 130 yards (120m) and width not less than 50 yards (45m) and not more than 100 yards (90m). \n\nFor International matches the length of a pitch must be between 110 yards (100m) and 120 yards (110m) and width not less than 70 yards (64m) and not more than 80 yards (75m). \n\nAs for how this was determined, you will probably find that over the years this has averaged out until someone at FIFA set the above dimensions.\n\nThere are set dimensions for everything from the size of the goal posts to the markings on the pitch.

0	are tarrot cards evil ? Yes, because they push a false belief that pulls away from God, and from trusting in Him.  \n\nThe same goes for those horoscopes that are in the newspaper.  There is absolutely no evidence that the movements of stars and planets, coupled with our birthdays, has anything to do with either our personalities or our future lives.\n\nAnd like tarot cards, they pull people away from God.  People who fall for this crap are basically saying that God isn't good enough for them -- that they don't have to trust Him and can find out their futures through some magic means.

6	Need advice on how to handle sexual harrassment over the phone? I run a small business that caters to Truck Drivers.  97% of our business is conducted over the phone all over the U.S.  Most of the time, these Truck Driver's are VERY upstanding, and show us a great deal of respect seeings how my office is 100% ran by females.  Recently, we had some very outlandish behavior come from a client that was directed at my assistant.  She didn't handle it well, and he continued on until it became very nasty.  What I'm looking for is some "one liners" to put these guys in their place without loosing business or reputation (which is totally word of mouth). Does anyone have some ideas?  REMEMBER we have to be nice! "One-liners" won't cut it.  The drivers who abuse your employees will continue to do so, unless they are told that their conduct toward your employees is unacceptable, and that you would rather lose their business than to subject your employees to that insulting behavior.  "One-liners", retorts, or  quips  will make the driver(s) think that you or your employees are flirting with them,   which will only encourage the unacceptable behavior. \n\nIn addition, by failing to stop such behavior, you are in fact condoning it and opening yourself to a "hostile work environment" lawsuit.  \n\nCan you afford a million dollar settlement, to keep a driver's business?

2	What effects would it have on my body if I were to go a week totally without food? Why Fast?\n\nWater fasting eliminates addictions, bad habits and unhealthy thought patterns. During the fast, the palate recovers its natural sensitivity to simple foods. Salt, sugar, fats and processed foods become naturally unattractive. Fasting is an ideal time to be introspective and honest with oneself. It is conducive to quiet observation of thought patterns and values.\nFree your body from disease or accumulated toxins.\n\nFasting is surgery without a knife. It allows nature and her healing power to take control of our being and do her cleansing and repair work. Fasting is a medical procedure, restoring homeostasis, strengthening the immune system and healing many illnesses\n\nFree your mind from unnecessary boundaries.\n\nFasting is also an ancient spiritual practice, withdrawing the energy from doing and transferring it into being in the moment. Fasting takes us to our truth, allows old wounds to heal, addictions to fade, and our ego to die to be reborn into our spirit.\n\nFasting brings the ultimate rest.\n\nFasting provides a framework in which change is effortless and comes from the deep self.\n\nWho can do it?\n\nFasting is beneficial to almost everybody with the exclusion of a few medical conditions.\nFasting may be practiced preventively to attain better health and longevity.\n\n\n Periodic fasting provides the rest for your digestive system. It allows your digestive system to recuperate from the rough treatment that you may have given it by overeating or eating the wrong foods or eating at the wrong time.\n\nIn addition fasting also provides an opportunity to eliminate many toxins from your body.\n Some people think that fasting is difficult. If you prepare yourself for fasting it is not difficult. Prepare yourself physically by taking enough food and also plenty of liquids the day before. Prepare yourself mentally by deciding the night before fasting: "Tomorrow is fasting day, and I am not going to eat anything." If you take this mental determination prior to the fasting day, you will not be hungry during the fasting day. If you don’t make a prior determination, during the fasting day you will start to think “Maybe I should eat, and fast another day!” Decide before hand and you will be able to complete your fast..\n\nAll in all, fasting is one of the best practices for maintaining physical, mental and spiritual health. I highly recommend it.

I need information on any new development with in the last 6 months on second hand smoking and banning smoking from public places. Thanks. All your information will be of great  help. THANKS There has been a mind-control program regarding second-hand smoke instigated by the controllers of the medical industry.\nThey are struggling to hide the fact that vaccinations are killing people, and they put it down to second hand smoke and sun bathing.\nSecond hand smoke has far less effect that the pollution from a passing car, and is certainly far less dangerous than vaccination.\n\nThe Vaccination Hoax\nhttp://www.whale.to/b/hoax1.html

7	its my birthday on monday - suggest a fantasy present that you would get me - im going to be 39? i like to be pampered - so be imaginative I'd pick you up in my ferrari and drive like a madman to the chopper that's parked outside Buckinghame palace, where the queen has been standing for 1 hour (in the cold with just her slippers & cardie on) waiting to wave you off.  After hovering above a few streets throwing large denomination notes to passers by we zoom off to our lear jet, parked at Heathrow, where a brass band plays a farewell to you.  On board we party like hollywood celebs whilst we fly to our private island (just off Miami - I had it specially built).  Once there we spend a few hours playing elephant polo with European royalty to relax, perhaps having a swim in the solid diamond pool filled with expensive champagne.  Then, after a vigerous rub down from Brad Pitt your whisked off on the back of a Harley Davidson (Ewan McGregor driving this time) to Las Vegas where we blow a couple of million in the casinos.  After arriving in Tokyo a few hours later (party all the way)on concorde (which I had specially re-instated for a one off flight, compliments of the British government), The Time life magazines top 500 most influencial people sing happy birthday to you, whilst a TV screen shows George Bush and Osama Bin Laden shaking hands and agreeing that your birthday has ushered forth a new era in world peace, whilst the pope tap dances in the background holding a card saying 'God bless you and your birthday'.  As a small finale the citizens of the middle east form the words 'God bless this day, Happy Birthday' in candle light.\n\nOh yeah, and George Clooney would appear to you in the firework celebration in the form of a large animated display, portraying him giving you a movie style kiss.  Whilst you were watching that he would secretly be getting your name tatooed on his arm and trying to gather the guts to ask you out on a date.\n\nHow does that sound?

3	what foods do egypt eat? its for a homework Because Egypt was very dry, and relied mostly on the Nile River to water the crops, the Egyptians could only grow certain kinds of food. Mainly they grew wheat and barley. \n\nThe Egyptians made the wheat into bread and into soup and porridge, and they also added hops to make the barley into beer. In fact, some people think the real reason that the Egyptians first began growing grain was to make beer. This is an Egyptian model of beer jars (from the Louvre), which the Egyptians made to put in your grave when you died so you would have beer in the next world.\n\n(from the Louvre, Paris, France)\nThe Egyptians also ate meat. You could go to a butcher shop and buy meat there, just as people do today. Only because it rarely rains in Egypt, they could have the meat outside in the courtyard of the store instead of inside. Here is a model of a butcher shop, also from somebody's grave. Can you see the different cuts of meat all laid out? At the very bottom there is a whole leg of mutton.\nBut the Egyptians would not eat pigs (bacon or ham or pork or salami) because they thought pigs carried leprosy. They ate beef and mutton and duck and goose. \nFor dessert, the Egyptians liked to eat dates. This is a picture of some real Egyptian dates which were put into somebody's grave for them to eat in the next world, and which were preserved in the dry climate for three thousand years until archaeologists dug them up again.\nArchaeologists have also found seeds which show that the Egyptians grew watermelons, and other kinds of melon.
9	should marijuana be leaglized for medical use? Marijuana actually has many helpful benefits toward diseases / sicknesses. Marijuana can reduce nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite caused by AIDS. It can Reduce interlobular pressure, which alleviates the pain and slowing and sometimes even stopping the progress of glaucoma. Common side effects of chemotherapy are nausea, loss of appetite, and vomiting, all of which marijuana would help.

6	Can anyone explain me what is the PRSI exactly? Thanks a lot. Most employers and employees (over 16 years of age) in Ireland pay social insurance contributions into Ireland's national Social Insurance Fund. In general, the payment of social insurance is compulsory. \n\nIreland's Social Insurance Fund is made up of a current account and an investment account managed by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance, respectively. The current account consists of monies collected from people in employment. This money is then paid back to fund social insurance benefits and entitlements. The investment account is a savings account that is managed by the Minister for Finance. The Comptroller and Auditor General has responsibility for ensuring that the accounts are kept in order and reports are made to the Houses of the Oireachtas. \n\nIf you are in employment, the amount of social insurance you pay depends on your earnings and the type of work you do. Your social insurance contributions in Ireland are referred to as PRSI (Pay Related Social Insurance). Sometimes, you will hear people describe their PRSI record as "stamps". This term dated from before 1979 when employers would literally stamp a card each week of employment. That card was then brought to a local social welfare office in order to claim social welfare payments. \n\nSince 1979, your employer keeps a record of the insurance contributions you make. These monies are now collected by the Revenue Commissioners who in turn make annual returns of these records to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. All records of your insurance contributions are kept by the PRSI Records section in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. \n\nSocial insurance rates\nFor people in employment in Ireland, social insurance contributions are divided into different categories, known as classes or rates of contribution. The type of class and rate that you pay is determined by the nature of your work. For example, a person employed in a supermarket earning less then 38 euro per week will be insured under Class J. If that person earned over 38 euro, they would probably be insured under Class A. In fact, most employees in Ireland pay Class A PRSI. This class of contribution may entitle you to the full range of insurance-based benefits that are available from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. \n\nThe other classes of social insurance are classes C, D, B, E, H, J, S, K, M, and P. If you are insured under one of these classes, you are paying insurance at a lower rate than Class A contributors, which means that you are not entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits. This is because you are paying less towards social insurance than a Class A contributor. \n\nExample: Joe earns less than 38 euro per week. He is insured under Class J, which only entitles him to Occupational Injuries Benefit. \n\nDetails of the different groups and occupations that these classes apply to and the benefits covered are contained in the Department of Social and Family Affairs Booklet SW14. (Also available from your local social welfare office). \n\nIf there is a problem in deciding what class of social insurance you should pay, the Scope Section in the Department of Social and Family Affairs may decide the issue after examining your employment situation. \n\nHow is social insurance (PRSI) paid?\nIf you are an employee, your social insurance contributions are deducted by your employer and collected by the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners then pay the money into the Social Insurance Fund. A record of the contributions you have paid is then sent to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Your employer will also pay social insurance on your behalf. \n\nAs well as paying into the Social Insurance Fund, you will also be expected to pay what is called the Health Contribution, which is charged at 2% on all income. The Health Contribution is not paid into the Social Insurance Fund. This money is collecte

1	what do you mean by event stratigraphy? how we interpret the ancient event when dealing with event st.graphy? Stratigraphy is the analysis of sediment layers and their correlation to time. Events in a stratigraphy are exceptional layers which were deposited due to a special occurrance - most commonly fire, but also think of the huge ash and lava deposits over Pompeii and Herculaneum, or the Iridium-rich layer on the end of the Jurassic Age commonly connected to the Yucatan meteorite impact.\n\nIn Archaeology or Palaeontology event layers are extremely valuable. Quite often they contain collateral damage of the event which can be dated to the event, and objects which normally wouldn't have been included in the sediment. Schliemann used the ash layers to distinguish several different stages of Troy. (Later research added more...)

4	where do program instructions and items of data move during the running of a simple file update program? Well, you'll need to be more specific than that. \n\nA file update can be done two ways: 1) by completely overwriting the existing one with a brand new one, or 2) by actually checking the bytes in old vs. new files, make comparisons, and develope a "difference script", so a "patcher" can use the difference script, plus the "difference" in content, to stitch together a new file. \n\nApproach 2) is definitely more complicated, and slower, theoretically, but the patch file would be tiny compared to the whole program. \n\nWithout knowing the internals of that "simple file update program", I'm going to guess it uses method 2 or something similar, thus the internals will move around.

2	Do you have to be out of breath to have a effective workout? That depends on what you mean by effective. If the "effect" you want is to gain cardiovascular health (heart health) than yes you should be slightly out of breath. You don't want to be gasping though. Especially when you first start working out. After a week or two, depending on many times a week you are exercising, it will not be as pronounced. If you are just focusing on building muscular strength you don't necessarily need to become out of breath.
0	Why do some people wear sunglasses when they are indoors?  Example a store or shopping mall.? If you take good care of yourself (=your eyes), you HAVE to keep them on, because if you take them off, your eyes are used to the light they get through the sunglasses and with the sudden "shot" of light that comes by taking them off, your eyes have to take in a massive dose of overexposure to UVA/UVB sunlight !!\n(Which explains why from a healthcare point of view, sunglasses aren't helpful att all!!)\n\nHappy sunbathing!!(without glasses,that is)\n\nCheers,\n\nLaurens.

9	Women should have a right to abort. right? i don't understand the rule? y bring an innocent life to earth when you don't have the money to bring it up or not ready to take responsibility of an innocent life? or that child is the result of rape,stupidity like not using a condom? I didn't take the time to read what the other people have written, so excuse me if I repeat anything that has already been said...\n\nYou have touched on the essential points.  There are so many children out there born to parents who can't or won't take care of them.  Is it fair to force that on a child?  If the mother is wise enough to recognize that she cannot properly care for a child, then kudos to her.\n\nAlso, many a mother has had to drop out of school, work two low paying part-time jobs, and basically give in to a crappy life for her and a life in daycare for her child because she is struggling to care for her child and make ends meet.  Let women choose to finish school and get a decent job before trying to bring a child into this world that they must support.\n\nAnd to all the people who disagree, how many unwanted children have they adopted?  how many hours do they spend mentoring children in foster care or in children's homes abandoned by their parents?  I would bet none of them has ever seen a child in foster care, not to mention helping any of them.  \n\nThe only demand in adoption is for healthy, white, newborn babies that come from healthy, educated parents.  There are thousands on wonderful children in foster care hoping for a home of their own.  Let's get all them adopted before we force more children to be brought into this world destined for the same fate!\n\nI will stop rambling now, but yes, it should be a choice that all women have a right to. \n\nOh yeah, and don't get me started on the fathers...how many dead beat dads are out there?  Just because the father decided today that he wants a baby doesn't mean he will be there emotionally or financially in the future.  It should be the mother's choice because the child will be her life long responsibility...

8	How I feel my daughters pain? My 15yr grl got in a fight with her BF.Her BF & another grl had a plot to ditch her next year. She was devastated last wkend.The following Mon.they got in a cat fight in PE over PE clothes.The XBF refused to let her dress out & dared her to punch her to get the clothes.My grl did so. The XBF grabbed her face and my grl did it again. Nxt thing the cops are at my door & my girl is cited.The school saw it as mutual combat,(we'll see what happens in court)The thing is my girl has been so hurt by this whole thing.I emailed the mom(no response)My girl emailed her BF(no response)the girls have been teasing my daughter on myspace& my daughter just wants the drama to end.She has even asked me several times,if the mom called me.It hurts me to see her so upset about this.She now has a trust issue."Mom, if you can't trust your BF who can you trust?"-Mom, imagine if your BF's planned to ditch you one day? She feels bad about the fight. She knows its wrong.The other party laughed,yet had her cited! I feel your pain also!  Our children just dont understand that when they hurt that we hurt!! I am sooooo sorry that it was her best friend because i know that it can be very hard on a 15 year old when they lose anyone close to them. Im sure that your daughter also confided in this friend and told her alot of things about her life that she wishes that she hadn't now. Tell her to just try to take things one day at a time, but take each day with alot of pride also, If the other girl sees that losing her friendship is bothering her than that will only make matters worse....so tell your daughter to just try to ignore everything they are saying(although I know it is hard!!), but if they see that it is not bothering her at all and that she has no problems making NEW friends then the girl will probably come back begging for her friendship!! And IF she does than your daughter needs to tell her NO because with Friends like that she sure does not need any enemies!!!!  I  dont know if this helps any but just thought i would write something because My 15 year old lost her father last year(in a motorcycle accident) and he was her BEST FRIEND and it was very very devastating. But in her case that is a person that she cant ever get back as a friend or father again. Just please make sure you are There for her Every Day until she gets through it though because sometimes things bother them alot more than they let on!!!  You sound like a wonderful mother with a very deep concern for your daughter!!!! Keep up the good work and just always be there for her.                                Hope it helps a little.

9	Define Feminist.? a feminist is a woman who is proud of being such. a feminist follows this doctrine:\n"when you see a really drunk girl leave a bar alone late at night and you follow her and make sure she gets inot her taxo all right. \nthat's self-protection.\nwhen you aren't afraid of looking like a supreme chickenshit and ask your friend to go into a public bathroom with you  because it creeps you out, but not for any intangible reason.\nthat's self-protection\n[...] \nwhen you dance, run, jump, buy yourself a birthday cake even though your birthday's five months away, cavort, kiss all the firls you love to love, laugh, sing, shout, jump rope, ding-dong ditch the house of someone who gets on your nerves, swing, climb trees, pick your nose in public, daydream, eat with your fingers, break something on purpose, fart loud, skip and pin your friends to the ground and tickle them, that's self-protection.\neverytime you look in the mirror and your heart races because you think, "i'm so fucking rad," that's self-protection. protect yourself."
5	Can anyone explain to me which each gear for each situation on a mountain bike? there's no one gear for any situation. \n\nWhether road or mountain you just need to get out there and get to know your bike. \n\nDo you switch to a high gear on downhills? mmmmm maybe. If your legs are tired you might want to "spin it out" on the way down. \n\nDo you gear down going uphill? mmmm maybe. There's what I've been told is the "magic gear" you're climbing, legs giving out or sore, stand and click up 2 gears higher and climb, had enough? click down two and hey, two lower gears I didn't know I had. \n\nEven the exact same route sometimes you feel fresh, climb in a higher gear, sometimes not so hot, lower than before. \n\nThere's no one gear ... just log off the dang computer and get outside and ride and get to know your bike.

Then find some guys, and go play basketball, or video games....... anything to take your mind off her. OTherwise, talk to her, see how she feels about you...... make sure your both on the same page, for if she is trying to push away, now would be the time to make the break, no matter how painful! good luck!

1	Is Chemistry a good subject to learn? Do chemists have future? Is chemistry a good subject to learn - yes, if for no other reason than to give you an appreciation for the world around you. As for if chemists have a future, everything around you probably had a chemist working on it. For example, the food you eat, the computer you are using, the water you drink, etc. all had chemists working on them. Quality control for purity  must be performed on almost everything, and that is normally done by a chemist. I recently graduated in chemistry, and I am having no difficulty finding jobs.

5	Hammer Head sharks,next swimming area? Me and my family this past weekend went to Clearwater Beach ,FL ,and we were fishing off of Pier 60,and everbody there was catching baby Hammer Head sharks,(they got bigger and bigger)but my question is if the babies are out their ,the mothers cant be to far behind ,right?(and that close to the swimming area) Well, most likely the mothers were not around. Hammers are a strange breed. They school a lot during the day, mostly small to medium.(credit of the lines below go to: .geocities.com/RainForest/Andes/1151/)\n\nAnother unusual thing hammerheads do is form schools. These schools can contain hundreds of individuals, with the largest known schools containing as many as 500. The reason why hammerheads school and other sharks do not is unknown. Hammerheads only school during the day. They break up at night to do their feeding. Because the schools contain mainly small to medium sized hammerheads, it is believed that they school to reduce the risk of predation from larger sharks. It is also believed that an order of dominance exists in the schools based on age, size and sex. \n\nI have attached a few links of my favorite hammer sites\n\nEnjoy and good to hear you took your family out fishing
0	What are the differences in christian religions? Like protastant, methodist, baptist etc... Doctrine. All Christians hold the basic concepts of Christianity and accept Christ as the Son of God and their Savior. Doctrine is the part of the Church where men try to interpret the meaning of God's word. In other words, translate the divine into mortal terms. Groups that agree or accept one interpretation belong to one denomination.\n   As a responsible christian, you should investigate and educate yourself on the doctrine of a church and then decide if you agree with it or not. If not, there are many others from which to choose. You can still be a christian and not belong to a particular denomination. The decision is yours to make.

2	can you claim benefit if you are diagnosed with fibromyalgia and unable to work.? I have this condition and support my blind,kidney dialysis dependant husband, with all the work I have to do to support my Husband this is making my condition worse, I am depressed and in constant pain making life very difficult, I  finished fultime work to look after my husband but my condition has got worse and the dss stopped my incapacity benefit which makes our finance situation worse and doesnt help my situation I have appealed against there discision the case comes up in december has anyone else been in this possition. I have M.E. I get income support (I was asked to choose between I.S and I.B- I chose the former because of the free NHS stuff). I also get DLA- middle care and high mobility. I also get blue badge/parking space at home and travel pass. \n\nAPPEAL!!! Get specialist help. A Welfare Rights Officer is who you need to see. I went to see one after being refused DLA for the third time to help me appeal and she went mad that I was refused after she read the medical report (which I requested a copy of). She also told me that the 2nd time I applied, the doctor who examined me was struck off and told me to appeal for that as well (as a late appeal). I won not only the appeal, but the backdated one too.\n\nGet to a Welfare Rights Officer now (they know what they are doing and seem to be feared by the DSS- they changed their mind about my recent appliction when I mentioned that I wanted all the info because I was going to see a Welfare Rights Officer). Its all very confusing. The DSS were at my appeal and were rude and scary and made me cry. \n\nBut just so you know, I don't think you can get Carers Allowance if you get DLA. And I hope your husband gets DLA as well as some other benefit. Not to mention a companion travel card and such, because he should. \n\nAs someone said, it is hard for the genuinely disabled due to those that just take it as an easy option or a reason not to work. Hence, perseverance shows genuine need.\n\nDon't be afraid to admit you need help and how much pain you are in. You are intitled to help. Appeal and apply for everything you can, the W.R Officer will tell you all you need to know. \n\nGood luck!

What do you guys think of french player Zidane who is retiring after this world cup and France's performance in the cup a few days ago He was one the best player ever. He could do something out of nothing. In the 1998 world cup, he was magnificent.I wish he was playing for my country, and we have extraordinary players ourselves. Too bad, he is past his prime. Happens to everybody.

1	how many blood types are in a humanbody? Humans have the following blood types along with their respective antigens and antibodies:\n\n    * Individuals with type A blood have red blood cells with antigen A on their surface and produce antibodies against antigen B in their blood serum. Therefore an A-negative person can only receive blood from another A-negative person or from an O-negative person.\n    * Individuals with type B blood have the opposite arrangement, antigen B on their cells and produce antibodies against antigen A in their serum. Therefore, a B-negative person can only receive blood from another B-negative person or from an O-negative person.\n    * Individuals with type AB blood have red blood cells with both antigens A and B and do not produce antibodies against either antigen in their serum. Therefore, a person with type AB-positive blood can safely receive any ABO type blood and is called a "universal receiver". However an AB-positive person cannot donate blood except to another AB-positive person.\n    * Individuals with type O blood have red blood cells with neither antigen but produce antibodies against both types of antigens. Therefore, a person with type O-negative blood can safely donate to a person with any ABO blood type and is called a "universal donor". However an O-negative person can only receive blood from another O-negative person.\n\nOverall, the O blood type is the most common blood type in the world, although in some areas, such as Sweden and Norway, the A group dominates. The A antigen is overall more common than the B antigen. Since the AB blood type requires the presence of both A and B antigens, the AB blood type is the rarest of the ABO blood types. There are known racial and geographic distributions of the ABO blood types. \n\nThe precise reason why people develop antibodies against an antigen they have never been exposed to is unknown. It is believed that some bacterial antigens are similar enough to the A and B glycoproteins, and that antibodies created against the bacteria will react to ABO-incompatible blood cells.\n\nApart from red blood cells, the ABO antigen is also expressed on the glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (vWF), which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, blood type O predisposes very slightly to bleeding, as vWF is degraded more rapidly. ABO antigens are also present in many other tissues such as liver, kidneys and lungs\n\nThe H antigen:\nThe A & B antigens are derived from a common precursor known as the H antigen. The H antigen is a glycosphingolipid (sphingolipid with carbohydrates bonded to the ceramide moiety) which is modified to produce the A and B antigens. In type O blood, it remains unchanged and consists of a chain of glucose, galactose, N-acetyl galactosamine, and fucose attached to the ceramide. Since it lacks N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) it is referred to as a globoside, not a ganglioside. Type A has an extra N-acetyl galactosamine bonded to the galactose near the end, while type B has a third galactose bonded to that near-end galactose.

5	how can you knock someone out in a street fight? I've been in 4 - 5 hundred fights and my primary knockout punch is a hook to the temple. Jab to the nose will cause them to close up in the front and then a left or right hook. \n\nAlso something I learned from karate is to visualize my fist not making contact til it hits the inside of the opposite side of their head, it causes a devastating punch if done properly like a horse kicking them.
8	What should I do if I'm not attracted to my partner anymore? He's gotten so damn ugly and thinks he's so cool! I strongly believe that his "ugliness" is more related with the change of behaviour towards you or others than it is related with physical appearance.\n\nIn any case, if you are "not attracted anymore" it is usually because of that you can't see the person you firstly loved. I think you just started to know him better, or that he's going through some big changes related to his character.\n\nCouples who love each other usually doesn't care much appearance.

6	Why did God make Satan? All of God's works are perfect; God is not the author of unrighteousness; so he did not create anyone wicked.(Deut.32:4; Ps.5:4) The one who became satan was originally a perfect son of God. When saying that the devil "did not stand fast in the truth", Jesus indicated that at one time satan was "in the truth".(John8:44) But, as is true of all of God's intelligent creatures, this spirit son was endowed with free will. He abused his freedom of choice, allowed feelings of self-importance to develop in his heart, began to crave worship that belonged only to God, and so enticed Adam and Eve to listen to him rather than obey God. Thus by his course of action he made himself Satan, which means "adversary".--Jas.1:14,15

8	Bi curious? I am a 23 year old female. I have been with my boyfriend for four years and love him to death. Him and I would love to try a three some. I think I am more curious than he is. I just don't know how to go about it. How do I find a female and how do I ask? Please help. I know how you feel.  Woman are so beautful.  I am a bi female.  Woman are much better kissers than men.  I can give you suggestions from my personal experinces.  Never invite a woman into your bedroom that is involed in your personal life.  You want someone that has no connection on a daily basis w/ the both of you.  Because this is all new to you it would help if the woman you invite has had some kind of experence.  It is hard to find a female.  So if this is the first time for you and her go for it.  You and your boyfriend need to talk openly and honestly about this.  Leave no dought or confussion between you guys. How far are you willing to let your boyfrined go?  2 woman together should be about the 2 woman. Not what the man wants.  A lot of times another female joining a couple will not want to have sex w/ the male. Sometimes a bi female will put up with a man just because she wants to enjoy his girl.  Your wanting to enjoy a females body and touch.  Try a strip club that has a lot of contact dancing or nude dancing.  If this excites you both then your both on the same path.  Not all 3 somes work out.  You might do more sexualy to the other woman then she is willing to do to you.  If you find out at some point during a 3 some you just can't do this, stop.   A lot of woman will not speak up.  If you feel that you are being pushed aside by your boyfriend and this other woman. Another words they are enjoying each other not you don't hang around for that. It may take 3, 4 ,5 times before you have a 3 some expierance that is even worth remembering. It ia all about what you and the female want to enjoy.  Most men will agree to just watch, because they want in on it. Check out a escort bussiness. Escorts are on a different level then eveyday people. You get what you want. She wont steal your man.  And she never has to see the both of you again. Escorts also know how to take charge and will.  Try kissing another female and if you are left wanting more than you are ready.

5	What mountain is the highest for skiing in British Columbia. And is it taller than Vermount and Montreals hill Whistler has the highest vertical (5200 feet), and I believe Kicking horse is the highest at +8000 feet.  Sunshine, which sits on the border between BC and AB, is at 9000 feet. Both of these are FAR more than vermont or montreal areas (I think an big hill in the east would have less than 1000 vertical feet-not including tremblant).

1	Is global warming a result of Industrialization?  What are other possiblilities? Industrialization sure contributes to the phenomenon known as global warming. But, if I am to understand correctly, then, according to a scientist featured in a program I once came across on the Discovery Channel (Canada), a couple of hundred million years ago, a most unique event occurred, one most rare and that never before occurred in earth's history.\n\nThere are 4 things that can and do dramatically affect the earth's temperature, besides the heat generated by its core. These are volcanic eruptions, especially gigantice ones such as the 1883 eruption of Mount Krakatoa in Indonesia, comet, asteroid and meteroic impacts, what phase the earth is in during its orbit around the sun and, finally, how far towards or away from the sun the axis it revolves around is tilting.\n\nAny one of these can reduce the earth's overall temperature and make for a harsher and/or longer winter. Two of these create truly severe conditions. But a couple of hundred million years ago, the incredible happened. The earth was in the long and most distant portion of its orbit around the sun, the portion we associate with winter, its axis was at its furthest possible tilt from the sun and it suffered a collision with a space object (though it's not clear yet whether this was a comet or an asteroid).\n\nThe fact that it was during its long, winter phase meant that the earth would be cold to begin with and would receive less light and heat from the sun than usual. The fact that its axis was at its furthest point from the sun meant that the winter season would be that much harsher and would last that much longer than usual. But the combined effect of all 3 factors created a vicious cycle.\n\nThe winter season meant that temperatures were cold to begin with and that there was snow and ice on the ground already. The distantly pointing axis and the particulates from the collision kept temperatures cold and reduced them further. This meant that come spring and summer, much less snow and ice melted than usual and at a much slower rate. This in turn meant that by the time the next winter season came, the precipitation (snow and ice) of the last one was still for the most part on the ground. This created a larger mass of ice and snow, which froze into ice. This larger mass further sucked even more heat from the air around it and the ground below it. That further reduced temperatures, which caused even more precipitation to fall and accumulate, resulting in an even larger mass of ice and snow. This created permanent glaciars and permitted the creation and growth of pernanent icecaps at the 2 poles. These events have since locked the earth in an ice age. An ice age has two periods, a warming period and a cooling period. \n\nSo what does this have to do with global warming you ask? Until such time as at least some scientists became convinced of the phenomenon you know as global warming, the earth was in a warming period. It is my opinion and belief, given the available data, that, just as the earth experienced the simultaneous occurrance of 3 factors that allowed the creation of permanent glaciars and polar ice-caps, it can also experience the simultaneous occurrance of factors at the other end of the spectrum and that that is what the earth is experiencing right now. So I believe that the phenomenon of global warming is natural, and thus I support it, but that is aggravated by industrialization (mostly the various forms of pollution and environmental degredation), which I do not support.\n\nWhatever your goals and intentions, the best thing you can do is to gather the maximum amount of available information, and understand what theories are being expounded and how many acknowledged figures support them, so as to be able to accurately and fairly perceive the situation as it truly is and form an informed and educated opinion about it. Finally, not to be selective or act as a form of propaganda, I highly recommend "State of Fear" by Mr. Micha

9	Why does the US give so much aid to Israel? The Israeli government is the largest recipient of US financial aid in the world, receiving over one-third of total US aid to foreign countries4, even though Israel’s population comprises just .001% of the world’s population and has one the world’s higher per capita incomes. \n\nSince 1949 the US has given Israel a total of $84,854,827,200. The interest costs born by US taxpayers on behalf of Israel are $49,937,000,000 – making the total amount of aid given to Israel since 1949 $134,791,507,200 (more than $134 billion).5\n\nSince 1992, the US has offered Israel an additional $2 billion in loan guarantees every year.6 \n\nThe U.S. should not be aiding Israel no more than it should have been aiding South Africa under apartheid, Iran under the Shah, Iraq's Saddam during his war with Iran, Cambodia under Pol Pot, or Indonesia during its campaign against the East Timorese. Yeah so what? And Israel is the only democracy in the middle east. And if they withdrew aid the Israelis would be murdered in there thousands by the Arabs. Would that sit well on your liberal conscience.

OK, I realize we're talking about a difference as great as Rasputin and Rebecca of Sunnybrook farm, but who would you choose to spend an hour chatting with?\n\nYou can have a dynamic, whirlwind exchange of views with Ann Coulter, who is witty, but who spews venom and answers everything with a tinge of sarcasm.  Or, you can have a pleasant, relaxing chat with the effervescent and convivial Susan Estrich, whose political views are not flamboyant.\n\nWebsites:  \nhttp://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/welcome.cgi\n\nhttp://www.creators.com/opinion_show.cfm?columnsName=ses Ann.

That's the issue I have.

3	If 45% of the school are boys and there are 858 girls, how many boys are enrolled? I need to know how to set problem up. Ninoguapo also didn't use a spell-checker!\n\nThe answer is 702. Here's how to get the answer.\n\nThe other way to say what this question is asking is this: If the school is 45% boys and 55% girls (which we know), then that means that the 858 girls are 55% of the total number in the school.\n\n"But," you say, "55% of WHAT????"\n\nYou can compare it using a ratio: 858 over "some magical unknown number" is the same as 55 over 100. So MULTIPLY 858 by 100, and then divide the answer by 55. That means the "magical unknown number" turns out to be 1,560...that's how many students there are in the school.\n\nTake out the girls (858) from the total (1,560) and you get...702. That's 45% of 1,560.

8	Why are there less relationships between black women and white men , and asian men and black women? I asked this question earlier in the society section but think I will get a more interesting set of answers here. Social pressure is an issue, but the key is social gradient.  Men need something to give them an “advantage” in the relationship so we know the woman will respect us: we want to be older, richer, more educated…\n\nBlack woman are often perceived as move aggressive or strong and this threatens the social gradient.  Therefore I would guess that White & Asian men avoid dating black woman because they are uncertain that she will respect him.

1	What's inside a black hole? I know no one really knows, but what would (theoretically) be inside a black hole? A ton of light, since none can escape? ...Ideas? I'm glad that you asked this question because I've actually been thinking about this for a long time.\n\nBlack holes. Well, they're basically infinitly dense matter with a gravitational field so strong that it litterally bends space. This is due to the immense matter that is contained within. How? Well imagine a star's gravity. A baby blackhole would have that star's pulling power and as it absorbs more matter, its gravity field and strength would increase exponentially. \nSimply put, as more and more matter is absorbed, the gravity field is so strong that for normal matter to exist in it, it would be virtually impossible which is why i belive that the matter that has once existed has become a form of raw material so densly packed that at the center of it, matter is becomming energy. \n(matter and energy are exchangeable as dictated by einstein's E=MC2 which dictates that E=Energy and M=Mass of an object times the speed of light SQUARED!!!! I mean holy crap man, thats alotta energy, which btw, states that technically, a suger cube can destroy the earth...anyway...)\nAt the center of a black hole, there is a sphere of EXTREMELY dense matter with (given time of course) the gravitation pull of a whole star system. Thus, in theory, a black hole never ceases to stop pulling in more spacial objects in. A black hole itself,however, would never really increase in size since each time it absorbs light and matter, its gravity would increase thus keeping the size at a constant. \nAt some point however, black holes would suck everything in and eventually, there would be alot of black holes left in the universe and they would eventually suck each other in and eventually become one big black hole with an empty universe. When this stage has been reached, the matter, with its gravitational field so strong, would collapse on itself or it would rip space apart. When it collapses, all the matter sucked in would be released in a form of energy and therefore creating a "Big Bang".

7	When was the last time you said...? "I'm going to kill you" and actually meant "kill" as opposed to "harm severely"?\n\nDid you go through with it? If you say "I'm going to kill you" and there's a witness or two, and you actually do the deed, then it is technically premeditated murder, as opposed to manslaughter or crime of passion.
9	What's more important to you, privacy or national security? people are so concerned that their privacy is being violated that they don't consider the fact that sometimes that is what is needed to happen to protect the entire American public. I guess as long as your secrets are private it doesn't matter how many innocent people die. Thoughts? I truly don't see why we should have to choose.  Many of the homeland security issues are a direct outflow of isolationist and/or imperialistic foreign policies which have caused nations to become envious and to fear and loathe us.  That is from where insecurity and terrorism emerges.  Quite frankly, if our federal government would make better choices, and not perpetually make America-centric policies to the detriment of the less-developed peoples of the world, we could go back to feeling far more secure without the constant infringements of our Constitutionally-derived and Constitutionally-protected privacy by the same government.

1	What is difference between circuit breaker and contactor? Most circuit breakers are thermal devices that when excess current run through them they heat up and trip (open up). They can also be used as a switch to open a circuit.\n\nA contactor is a electric relay that is essentially a solenoid and a pair of electrical contacts. The solenoid is activated and it closes the contacts. They are typically used to permit a low voltage circuit or small switch to activate the solenoid so the much larger "switch" in the form of the contacts can close a higher voltage or higher amperage circuit. They can also be used for remote control of a electrical circuit.\n\nA good example if the starter solenoid on your car. It is really a contactor activated by the turning of the key to start the car. The amperage to run the starter motor is relatively large and requires relatively large wiring and a "large" switch.

6	Does paying off collection accounts on your credit profile make your score go up.  If yes, by how much? The important thing when dealing with paying off your old debt is to be CERTAIN that any negative report is removed from your credit history.  Just saying it's "paid in full" means nothing when it also says it was in collections or late payments.\n\nBefore you pay a dime on you debt, be sure the creditor agrees IN WRITING to remove the listing from your history.  Once they have your money it's not likely they will work with you.\n\nBy the way, if the creditor tells you it's illegal for them to do it, they are lying.  Read the Fair Credit Reporting act, and the Fair and Accurate Reporting Act.  There is noting in there preventing a creditor from removing their listings!
3	How can i get into Boston University? What kind of GPA do i need? You might get a sense as to whether you would qualify for admission at Boston University by taking a look at their current enrollment statistics:\n\nAverage GPA:  3.49 \nAverage SAT:  1278 \nAverage ACT:  28\n\nAlso, check out their page for freshman applicants. It gives you application instructions, requirements and standards, critical dates, etc.\n\nhttp://www.bu.edu/admissions/apply/fresh_admissions.html\n\nIn general, besides good grades and standardized test scores, schools are looking for students who are well-balanced, involved in extra-curricular activities, and active in their communities. I don't know what year of high school you're in, but you might want to start reading some of the many books that are available. The earlier you start preparing, the better.\n\nOne last thing - try not to stress out too much! If you don't get into the college of your choice, it's not the end of the world. I didn't do that well in high school and didn't get into any of the schools I wanted to go to. I ended up doing two years of community college, getting really good grades, and transfering into a prestigious university. So do the best you can, but at the same time, try to relax and enjoy the process.\n\nFinally, here's a book that looks kind of interesting. It's designed for students who "have a wide range of abilities," but aren't "necessarily the cream of the crop academically." It gets terrific reviews:\n\nColleges That Change Lives: 40 Schools You Should Know About Even If You're Not a Straight-A Student\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Colleges-That-Change-Lives-Straight/dp/0140296166/\n\nGood luck!

0	Did Adam, (the first man) have another wife before Eve? What is her story? The Story of Lilith is this - that she was created just as Adam, directly of the breath of God - not from Adam's side as was Eve. In some accounts she rejects Adam because he does not respect her as an equal. The idea that she is banished is incorrect - she calls out Gods name to repel Adam as she struggles with him and he is stunned by the power of that name, then she leaves Eden because she is filled with fury and anger towards Adam. \n\nNote that Lilith and all her descendents are therefore free of the "original sin" of eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and are -not- banished from the garden.\n\nEventually Adam complains to God that he is lonely - in response to the prayer of Adam, God sends out angels to grant his prayers. The angels attempt ask Lilith to return but She refuses. Since God has given her free-will, the angels are forbidden to interfere with her decision but they must do as God has commanded them. As she rests in the waters of the sea, the angels cause her to give birth to 100 children each day, (perhaps this was an alternate solution? an attempt to alleviate Adam's loneliness?). She elects to kill her own children out of spite, and in frustration the angels place curses upon her saying she must kill all her children until she returns. If she was to return to Eden the curse would be broken. One angel attempted to break her resistance by hiding some of her children - transforming them into monsters so she does not recognize them, for this reason Lilith is called the mother of demons, djinn, witches, etc.
6	Why does a project manager have to play psychologist? You have to play psychologist because that's your job...  The success of the project ultimately comes down to one person, the project manager, but that hardly seems fair because any number of people are working on that project.  In theory, happy people are more productive right?  And you want to get the most out of everyone who is working with you right? You don't have to be one, just learn to play the role.
2	What will you do when you feel sleepy whlle you are working? Have you got Sleepy`s permission?
7	Is there an outfit that you bought, wore once, and now do not want to wear again? Yes, there is.  The one I wore to my fathers funeral.  Won't ever wear that one again.
9	Can you name the Presidents during your life time? Since 1953: DDE 8 years. JFK 2 years. LBJ 6 years. RMN 6 years. GRF 2 years. JEC 4 years. RWR 8 years. GHWB 4 years. WJC 8 years. GWB 6 years. 34 years total, Republicans. total 20 years, Dems. Hey, wait a minute. Republicans have more time than Dems. Is there a connection here? My wife named our two girls, so my only chance to name a president during my lifetime would be my son, Josiah.  He'll be three in December, so we'll have to wait another 34 years(until the first presidential election after he's 35 yrs old) before I'll know for sure if I've named a president in my lifetime.
9	Is democracy an acceptable form of government throughout the world? Maybe Islam doesn't allow for freedom. I see women treated very differently then men in Muslim countires and maybe it's impossible to have freedom of different kinds in certain cultures. Maybe women like to be oppresssed and enslaved in certain circumstances. Maybe men do. Serbs, Tutsies etc. have killed there neighbors endlessly. How long was the Iraq/Iran war? Didn't they have children clear mine fields by walking in them? Maybe we can only live under a benevolent dictator No, it just doesn't work in some cultures. Look at the former USSR... the Communist Party is coming back stronger than ever and it's because Democracy in Russia has put so many people into the streets and the Russian mobsters have taken over just about everything over there including many top positions in Government. Many Russians have been protesting to have the Communist's put back into power. For the last year or so, Russians have had to do something they have not had to do before...They now have to pay their own utility bills. Now they have to pay for water, gas and electricity. \n\nI feel that Socialism and Democracy can work well together if implemented correctly. You can have a Socialist Government and still have Freedom. \n\nThat form of Government should be put into practice here in the USA. I don't know about you but I am tired of having 5% of the people here in the USA controling 95% of the wealth!\n\nPower should never be allowed to be in the hands of one person!\n\nMany Americans don't see it yet but in the last decade, we have been losing some of our freedoms! (Think about it).\n\nWomen should be treated as equals all over the world. I believe that day will come.\n\nBy the way, the Iran/Iraq War lasted from 1980 - 1988.
0	Why Can't Women Take Emergency Pills After 52 Hours Of Unprotected Contact? Well, I know this should have been in the Pregnancy category, but this may involve more moral issues than it seems. I'm a volunteer at a family planning org. in a country where abortion is illegal, and I've asked this question but the answers so far have been varied, which makes it confusing. surely its more to do with the effectiveness of the pill. in britain you can take it upto 72 hours later, but if you wait that long its only 50% as likely to prevent pregnancy than if you take it straight away.\n\ni think its more to do with the fact that the longer you leave it, the more likely it is that the embryo will have planted itself in the uterine lining, and that the body will have signalled the release of progesterone - the pregnancy hormone. after this time, you are pregnant, and only a much stronger pill that will cuase contractions of the unterus to dispell the embryo, will work.

0	Is it proper to have more than one baby shower? My sister is on her 5th child and is having a baby shower.  I thought that was only for the first one.  Or am I wrong? it depends. there are some families where the do one for every child, depending on the culture and traditions. do not feel obligated to buy an extravagant gift if you want to participate. some mothers have a large gap between children, such as me and my brother are 12 years apart, so my mother didn't have anything. others may choose to if they are with a different father, and it is the first grandbaby for that family also. \ntraditionally a baby shower was for the first child of a couple, but now days--- who sticks with all the tradition anyways?!?
0	What should be done about child predators? I think they should experience the same crime they put their victims through. That will be real justice. If there is absolutely no doubt that the predator did the crime they're accused of, the childs family should have first crack at the predator.\n\nI know I would stand a good chance of going to jail if anyone ever hurt one of my kids.  It would be hard not to go after that person and take care of them myself.  Too bad parents don't have that right...or at least be given lesser punishments.\n\nI've always heard that child predators are "taken care of" in jail by the other inmates.....I sincerely hope that is true.\n\nShort of that, I think cutting off their offending appendages would suffice.

5	Do u know who Christoph Metzelder is? Christoph Metzelder (born November 5, 1980 in Haltern, North Rhine Westphalia, Germany) is a football defender for Borussia Dortmund. He is currently considered one of Germany's most talented defenders.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Metzelder signed for Borussia, and he was an instant success. He not only won the German championships with BVB in 2002 as a regular first team player, he also reached the 2002 World Cup final with Germany. In the tournament, he was also voted the "Best Player Under The Age of 23". But despite offers from other big clubs, he extended his contract until 2005. After his long injury lay-off, fans and team-mates are now both hoping that Metzelder will be able to make a comeback next season that mirrored the start of his career four years ago.\n\nOne can hardly fail to notice the main strength of the BVB skipper: With a height of 1.94 metres, Metzelder is outstanding in the air. And despite his young age, the centre back, who can also play on the right of defence, has nerves of steel and necessary combination of composure and confidence. This, along with his superb tackling skills, both in the air and on the ground, make Metzelder a very good defensive player.\n\nProfile\nDate of birth: 05.11.1980 \nPlace of Birth: Haltern \nSign of the zodiac: Scorpio \nNation: Germany \nHeight: 194 cm \nWeight: 84 kg \nNumber: 21 \nPosition: Defender \n\nHonours\nGerman Champion 2002 \n2002 World Cup Runner Up \n\nClubs\nBorussia Dortmund \nPreußen Münster \nFC Schalke 04 \nTuS Haltern

1	what is the differnce between current and charge? also wat r transformers? Electric current is the rate of charge flow past a given point in an electric circuit, measured in coulombs/second which is named amperes.\n\nA transformer is an electrical device that transfers energy from one circuit to another by magnetic coupling with no moving parts. A transformer comprises two or more coupled windings, or a single tapped winding and, in most cases, a magnetic core to concentrate magnetic flux.  Transformers are used to convert between high and low voltages, to change impedance, and to provide electrical isolation between circuits.

1	PSII absorbs light energy and raises an electron to a higher energy level. This energy is used to do what? "Energetic Electrons (from:refernce listed below)\n \nPhotosystem II is the first link in the chain of photosynthesis. It captures photons and uses the energy to extract electrons from water molecules. These electrons are used in several ways. First, when the electrons are removed, the water molecule is broken into oxygen gas, which bubbles away, and hydrogen ions, which are used to power ATP synthesis. This is the source of all of the oxygen that we breathe. Second, the electrons are passed down a chain of electron-carrying proteins, getting an additional boost along the way from photosystem I. As these electrons flow down the chain, they are used to pump hydrogen ions across the membrane, providing even more power for ATP synthesis. Finally, the electrons are placed on a carrier molecule, NADPH, which delivers them to enzymes that build sugar from water and carbon dioxide." \n\nIn a nutshell, these energized electrons provide the energy for anything in the cell that needs energy.

5	What's the difference between all of the different types of double plays in baseball? I've heard all of these different combinations of numbers. How do these work? The most normal is 6-4-3 or 5-4-3 DP\n\n6 is the 3rd baseman\n5 is the shortstop\n4 is the 2nd basebman\n3 is the 1st baseman.\n\nSo, a 6-4-3 DP is ground ball to 3rd, throw to 2nd for force, then to 1st to complete it.\n\nOr sometimes there is a strike 'em out/throw him out DP's...Those are the coolest.\n\nThe batter strikes out (k), then the catcher throws to 2nd to catch the runner trying to steal.\n\nAnother cool DP is when there is a fly ball to the outfield, runner on thrid trying to score, and is thrown out at home.

8	Now i'm 16 years. my friend's b/f who just broke wit my friend,told me that he luv me. Should I luv him? I fall in love with my friend's boyfriend name Vuthy for along time  ago, but now it's my chance to be his girlfriend. Vuthy broke with my friend for 2 month ago. when he is my friend b/f. I think he love me too. And now he told me that he love me. I really love him, sometimes I think that Life without him has no meaning to me. The problem is I also don't want to upset my freind, Cause she still love her boyfriend. Now she is very brokenheart. What should I do? If I told Vuthy that I don't love him, I will lose my chance and having regrets 4ever. But if I told him I agree to be his girlfriend, I will became a very bad friend, and not happy about it. Cos she is my best friend. Please tell me the solution to this problem It depends what you value more - your friendship or a potential relationship with Vuthy. It may well be that he wants to be with you and technically, as he is now single, you are free to pursue a relationship with him. \nBut if your friend still has feelings for him, she will probably be hurt if you and he get together and you may lose her as a friend. Id talk to her about it first and guage her reaction.

2	Done by Christmas??? I want to loose about 15 pounds by Christmas; starting tomorrow (Sunday). My family always eats junky around Holidays, so I wanted to loose some weight so I don't have to worry too much about messing up my current weight. I'm 5'  1 1/2" tall, and weigh 113.5 pounds....Please help. Cut back on junk you're eating now including sweets, chips, soda and frozen snack foods.\n\nLimit fast food to 1X a week.  \n\nPay attention to serving sizes (like when pouring cereal for example).  Stop eating when you're satisfied, not stuffed.  Pick veggies & salads more often, but use low cal dressing.\n\nFind an activity to do every day.  It doesn't burn many calories, but it helps.  Frisbee, dog walking, dancing, bowling, serious housework all counts.\n\nFor motivation check out the Success Stories at the Kimkins diet website.

3	Who is the prime minister of Andhra Pradesh? Chief Minister is Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, born in 1949, popularly known as Y.S.R.\nHe is known for his forthright speech and frank approach. Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy hails from Pulivendula, a small town from Cuddapah district of the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nDr.Reddy belongs to the Indian National Congress party and was elected to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from the Pulivendula Assembly Constituency of Cuddapah District. He has been Chief Minister since May 14, 2004. He served as the leader of the Opposition in the House for the previous term during which N. Chandrababu Naidu was the Chief Minister.\n\nY.S.R. is a medical science graduate from the M.R. College of Gulbargaa. He did his House-Surgency in Sri Venkateshwara Medical College, Tirupathi. Upon completion of his MBBS degree, he served as Medical Officer in Church of South India's Campbell Hospital in Jammalamadugu in the Diocese of Nandyal for a brief period of time. In 1973 he established a 70-bed charitable hospital at Pulivendula in the name of his father, Sri Y. S. Raja Reddy. The hospital continues to serve the poor to date.\n\nA doctor by profession, Reddy made his debut in politics as a Youth Congress Leader. It is interesting to note that he and his present opponent, TDP President Nara Chandrababu Naidu, made their debut at the same time (1978) in the Andhra Pradesh State Legislative Assembly as young legislators of the Congress party. They both worked together as Ministers in Sri. Tanguturi Anjaiah’s cabinet. In fact Sri Chandrababu Naidu acknowledges him as his mentor in politics.\n\nY.S.R. had an active political career over a quarter of a century and has been representing his party on different fora. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Cuddapah constituency four times, and a similar number of times to the Andhra Pradesh State Assembly, from the Pulivendula constituency. He twice served as the APCC President. He remains one of the very few national politicians who have never lost an election.
2	Body Fat percent? I need to calculate my body fat percent. Is there a calculation to do this? I had it tested in PE last year but I think it is innaccurate. It said like 26% but i am pretty skinny and just  have fat in my stomach and chest area. Plus any tips on making it go down. You're right, if you are skinny, I doubt you have 26% body fat as that would make you overfat.\n\nThere are a couple of online calculators I found (see below), that may give you a rought estimate, but it would be best to have it checked professionally and not by one of those hand held devices.\n\nHowever, just remember if you store all your fat in one area, such as the stomach, it may not be entirely accurate.\n\nHTH : )

9	why is their so much tragedy in our world? IS IT BECAUSE WE HAVE CHOSEN WRONG LEADERS OF OUR TIME,\nTHAT HAS CAUSED DEATH AND MISERY AROUND THE WORLD AND \nHAVE NO HUMAN VALUE. I don't think we are able to pin point a specific reason why.  Even though I hate Bush and everything he stands for, I can't blame him for everything that happens, but I will blame him for everything and anything that has to do with the government, like help to Katrina victims, Sept 11th, the war in Iraq, the deficit spending, social security's bankruptcy... things of that nature.  But there some even worst things happening like natural disasters killing hundreds of thousands that you just can't blame on anybody.  I guess these are the times we're living in and we should pick leaders who are apt and know how to handle such conflict and tragedy.

4	Whats the best ISP?Cable, Dial up, DSL, etc.? DSL, ISDN, Dialup, Cable, Satellite, or any others?\ntakes everything into consideration, price, quatilty, features, speed, etc. Cable is the quickest, clocked at about 3 megs. DSL is also around 3 megs, and they are both the same. The difference? Users. Cable is based on how many people use it. The more you have, the faster it is. Talk to people in your neighborhood. If you get mostly cable users, use cable. DSL is more reliable if most don't have cable. They are both fast, but cable will be faster MORE often than DSL,, but keep in mind DSL's variations are smaller than Cable, because somedays cable can be Dial up slow, but others T1 fast.\n\nAlso, Cable is only available is 3 megs, and is expensive. YOu can get 3 levels of DSL, lite (256 Kbps) regular (1400 Kbps) and high speed (3000 Kbps or 3 megs). If you don't need the fastest, DSL is the best choice because it is more cost effective. Regular speed DSL cost me about 40 a month, and Cable runs about 70-80.

It is dangerous to memorize the words because you can always forget.
4	What skills do you need to be a level designer? I also have another questions. What is the main program that companies use, so i could get some expirence with it. Assuming that you are refering to graphic design or web design I will answer your questions.\n\nFirst program to learn is Photoshop by Adobe.  Photoshop is the industry leader in raster based editing but it also works with vector based images.  Photoshop is used to create graphics, edit photos, create web pages and much more.  Total Training has excellent DVD training videos for starters.  They are kinda expensive but so is Photoshop.  ;)\n\nSkills needed;  Learn your software packages like Adobe, flash, etc.  Also learn your theory.  Be sure to understand how a computer works - things like RAM, processor speed, monitors and peripherals.  Study compatibility across operating systems like Windows, MAC, Unix/Linux, etc.\n\nMy recommendation is to get formal training from a school.  This will ensure that you are learning the right things and it lets your employer know that you are qualified.

1	Have you ever been bit by an assasin bug? I found an assasin bug under my mattress.  He bit me twice during the night and it swelled up bad.  I was wondering if anyone else had the same experience? The assassin bug has been known to bite humans when not handled carefully. For some species the bite is known to be very painful, sometimes with effects lasting up to four months, at times causing allergic reactions. Repeated bites can cause increasingly bad reactions in humans including shock and death.\n\n\nSome blood-sucking reduviidae, particularly Triatoma spp. and other members of the subfamily Triatominae, are also known as kissing bugs due to the most common location of bites on humans being near the soft tissue of the lips and eyes; about half of these [haematophageous] species, located in Central and South America are able to transmit a fatal trypanosome disease known as Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis).\n\n=====\n\nBITES FROM WHEEL BUGS\nSome assassin bugs, most notably the wheel bug, will bite if picked up and handled carelessly.  The bite of the wheel bug is immediately and intensely painful.  Persons who are bitten should wash and apply antiseptic to the site of the bite.  Oral analgesics, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, may be useful to reduce the pain.  Treatment by a physician is not usually needed, though Caladryl® or topical corticosteroids may help reduce swelling or itching at the site of the bite.  As with any insect sting or bite, the victim should seek medical attention immediately if there is any sign of anaphylactic reaction, such as generalized swelling, itching, hives or difficulty breathing.

2	Anyone have Endometriosis? I do, and i have had surgery once for it, but it seems like it's back.  Has anyone ever had multiple surgeries for it?  Also, does it cause a lack of energy?  One more thing, I heard that it is also an immunity disease, does that mean you are more prone to colds and stuff also?  It seems like I get sick alot more than i used to. Contact the Center for Endometriosis Care at www.centerforendo.com.  They perform surgical excision, which is shown to be 85% effective for long-term relief, versus superficial surgical treatments like ablation, fulguration, vaporization, etc.  The key to treating the disease is to truly remove it all.  Endo has an autoimmune component, which you can learn more about from the Endo Research Center at www.endocenter.org.  They also have a discussion group at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/erc which you might benefit from.  Good luck and remember you don't have to suffer.  You're not alone!
0	Has God ever spaken to you directly? Or did hew send an angel as a messenger?  What did He say?  Did other people believe you? At the age of seventeen I was praying on my bed to God because my heart ached at all the pain and suffering in the world.  I had searched all sorts of places for God, and not found him (I was fairly ignorant of how far that trip can lead a person).  I went through a number of mental adaptations as I realized that I didn't need to pray out loud, then realized I didn't need to ask him, then realized I didn't need to address him mentally, etc.\n\nShort version of the rest: Five hours later, I became aware of having a body, an identity, and had the memory of having experienced everything, everywhere, simultaneously throughout time and beyond.\n\nI walked out and my mother asked where I had been.  I told her I was in my room.  For one of the only rare times in her life, she got angry, and she was angry because she said she had checked my room, and I wasn't there.  She told me to get ready for dinner, I was later (that's how I knew five hours had passed).\n\nI spent the next year in absolute bliss, free of anger, fear, frustration, worry.  My mental abilities were greatly increased, and much of what people call psychic abilities were common place for me.  I was utterly happy and loved everyone and everything (still do).  In time, I lost some of it, kept  a lot, and share it with those who really want to be happy.\n\nNo message, no mission, no crowning saying I'm special.  Just the opposite.  I can never kid myself into thinking I'm better than anyone, or they better than me.\n\nSometimes I wish there had been a message.  It would have made it all easier, or perhaps harder.  I don't know.\n\nFew believed me.  My parents did.  My psychologist did (I went to one to insure that I hadn't had a psychotic break.  He suggested that since the only apparent effects were positive ones, I really didn't need to come see him).  I also had a cat-scan (best to be cautious when you've experienced God first-hand!)\n\nMost people don't believe me.  Doesn't matter.  My wife and daughter benefit, as do I, as do others who simply have a saner, happier, more productive person in their lives.\n\nGood luck in your search.  There is so much wisdom out there, and so many of us want to encourage you, no  matter what spiritual path you take.

9	Please discuss? A skeptic approaches you regarding the up coming elections with the retort all politicians are liars. You do not believe your candidate is a liar and want to rebuke the skeptics claim. How could the square of opposition or the immediate inferences found through obversion, conversion and contraposition help you in your quest. I dont believe that our politicians are liars any more than anyone else.  They probably live more honestly than most.  Anyhow, we live in whats known as a "representative republic".  That means our elected officials are chosen by whom best represents the people there, or at least the people that voted.  So, if you think all politicians are liars you can do two things:  1. be vocal about the fact that you want someone who is honest and will do what they say they will do (George W. Bush did do that look it up) and 2. you vote.  People often get the leadership they deserve.

0	Whatever happened to personal responsibility? Theres alot of questions latley pointing out the killing of women and children in the Bible, such as the flood, or the Prophecy in Isaiah.\n\nGod gave them warnings, a chance to repent, and yet people, knowing that they were acting against God, decided to ignore it. And yes, their children died, for the choices THEY made. The parents themselves, by ignoring God, brought death to themsleves and their families. \n\nGod gave them a chance, were they not personally responsible for what happened? They had an out, they didnt take it. People ultimately are responsible for the actions they take.  We are all beings that have a mind and should be able to use it.  The problem is you are going to see those type of examples in a world where its easier to shift blame then to take the responsibility.  \n\nIt's so much easier to shift the blame saying I was abused, or this happened to me, so feel sorry for me.  In this way the person becomes a victim and the blame and responsibility is shifted to another source.  This creates an endless cycle as the blame just keeps getting shifted.  In doing so those originally responsible often get sympathy and their deeds will not seem so bad to many.\n\nPersonally, its tiring to consistently see someone push the blame away that way.  We as people are individuals and ultimately responsible to what happens to ourselves.  If you are strong enough to shirk your responsibility to others or yourself, then you should be strong enough to say, "Yes, I'm responsible."  \n\nHowever this type of blame game will continue as long as society allows it to and thus is shifted to the deeds of the past.

0	Should Gays Be Ordained? (Anti-gay individuals do not reply)? Earlier this year the Vatican issued an order of sorts barring gay men from Ordination. This was a reaction to the several priests who have molested young boys, often altar servers over the years. I am not talking about them.\n\nThere hundreds if not thousands of priests, bishop's and relegios out there who are gay and you will never hear about them, but the World Press is out to make all priests look unworthy.\n\nAlthough I am not attached to Rome, but am from an Independant Jurisdiction, I have seen many RC Priests, who have never done anything to anyone that have felt like they are not worth anything for all the service rendered over thier years.\n\nIf your going to pick up the anti-gay banner don't answer this question. .Our society seems to focus on those who may cause pain to others and therefore judge all that are in that race, culture or now the gay rights issue.  I can only say that I agreed with you.  There are people who are social deviance in every aspect of life.  But, like the old saying goods all it takes is a few bad apples to ruin the whole barrel.  We are supposedly to be an intelligent society and should gain insight from past mistakes and not label everyone who is in that genre as equally deviant.

6	I need help in making Health Insurance decisions.... let me explain:? My husband and I are both disabled. We both receive Medicare Parts A & B. Husband took disability retirement 8 years ago from the VA (Federal Government), and through them, we pay a monthly premium for Aetna health insurance, which helps to cover my expensive prescriptions. We thought that Aetna would pick up the leftover costs of whatever Medicare did not cover. WRONG. The Aetna policy we have is not a Medicare Supplement plan; just a plain vanilla healthcare HMO. I've been trying to do some research, but it is driving me crazy trying to decipher what the Federal Government offers its disability-retirement employees versus what Medicare offers, including its Plan D for prescriptions. I've already used some of the online decision-making tools, but I'm still not getting a clear picture of what's out there and how we would save any $$.There are seminars all over the county put on by local BC/BS Medicare Advantage plans, but they are all trying to sell something.Whom can I trust to help? If you have expensive medicines, you need to seriously consider enrolling in Medicare Part D coverage.\n\nDespite all the complexity, you need to get on a Part D plan.\n\nIt is a true shame that lawmakers when passing first the Discount Drug Cards and now the Part D plans could not have simply made it easier for seniors and the disabled to understand.\n\nUnfortunately there is no one central, trusted and unobjective resource for making this easier.\n\nThe on-line tools you are using may be your best bet.

9	can anyone help a first time voter? this is my very first time voting and i'm glad to be part of it. But, I still don't understand everything, yet.  I have a mix of republics and democrats on my list of people i want to vote for. I was told that I could only vote for one side. I don't agree with everything on just one side. Is there a way I can vote for the people I want to see make it? Remember this is my first time at voting so, all this is new to me. I have done my homework on the issues and where these people stand. How does voting work? Do we all get the same list and we can vote for who we want or do you tell "them" what side we are on and they give us that sides list?  \nI hope I haven't confused anyone. I just don't understand what to do, yet.  Plus, I'm not for sure if I'm republican or democrat since, my list is an, almost, equal split of both sides.\nWhat am I suppose to say when they ask me what side I am on? By all means you can vote for both Republican and Democrats.  You sound like a great U.S. citizen.  I wish more people would research and vote for the person...not the party.\n\nNo one will ask you 'what side you are on' and yes, we all get the same list.  Ignore the party and vote for the person you have decided on.\n\nJust register as an Independent.  You won't be able to vote in the primary elections but I don't think that will bother you.  \n\nVOTE YOUR CONSCIOUS.  I admire you a lot!

4	what is muzula program? Mozilla is a computer term that has had many different uses, though all of them have been related to Netscape Communications Corporation and its related application software. The various uses of Mozilla (all of which can be referred to by using just the term "Mozilla") are listed below in the order when they were first used:\n\n\nCodename of Netscape Navigator\nMain article: Netscape Navigator \nMozilla is a trademark of the Mozilla Foundation and historically had been used internally as a codename for the Netscape Navigator web browser from its beginning. It was a contraction of Mosaic killer, referring to the hope that the project would unseat Mosaic as the web's most popular browser, and a reference to the name of the fictional monster Godzilla.
1	what is link ratio method? Several methodologies are used in Main Economic Indicators (MEI) to link time series. The preferred method, and the one most widely used, is the 12-month or 4-quarter link method.  This method can be applied when an old and new series (which are being linked) contain data for an overlapping time period of at least one year.\n\nThe 12-month (4-quarter) link method calculates a linking factor as the average of the first common year of observations of the new series divided by the equivalent observations of the old series.  This method is robust, in particular when revisions have been made with the introduction of the new series.  Also, this method ensures as best as possible that consistency is maintained between raw and seasonally adjusted versions of the same series.  An exception to this procedure is made in the case of Price Indices, where use of the first common period link method is preferred.  This method calculates a linking factor as the ratio of the first observation of the new series to the equivalent observation of the old series in the overlapping period.  This method ensures the same monthly growth rate at the link point for the new and old Price Indices and minimises the impact on the long time series if major changes are made to the coverage of the new Price Index. \n\nUse of the first common period link method can cause a spurious relationship between the raw and seasonally adjusted versions of the new series prior to the link point (i.e. after the link has been made), which is the primary reason why the 12-month link method is preferred for most time series.  However this is not an issue for Price Indices as these are generally not seasonally adjusted.  Where a full common year between old and new series provided by a country does not exist, the first common period link method will be used.  Also, if there has been no revision to the new series over the first common year, these two linking methods yield the same result. The choice of preferred linking method was decided after detailed methodological and empirical study by the OECD Secretariat.\n\nThe implicit link method is used to link series which share no explicit overlapping period, but for which a common reference period can be established by inference or deduction.  For example, the method could use the information that for the two series, a common base year value is 100. The two series can then be re-referenced to this common base year and then concatenated (i.e. joined).  Note that the information set which necessitates using this link method is rarely found in practice so its use is infrequent.\n\nSome series expressed in levels (such as monetary series measured in currency and series covering western and later unified Germany) are joined by concatenation. This means that values of the new series replace or are added to the old series from the first observation of the new series. As a result of its construction, this method may produce one or more significant ruptures (i.e. series breaks) in the linked series at the link point(s). However, such ruptures are documented in the publications and the database.\n\nMain Economic Indicators investigates each series on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they should be linked or not. If they should, then the most appropriate method is determined by in-depth analysis. Series with little in common methodologically, or those that exhibit significant differences in their evolution are not linked. Furthermore, different methods may be used for different links within the same series, depending on the nature of the old and new data series being linked at the particular point in time.  In general it is the policy of the MEI to try and maintain long time series, and therefore our preference is to link series wherever possible and provide appropriate metadata to users.

I mean, I get how he was crucified.. but how is that dying for me? please try to keep your answers short please. :D this is hard to answer and to be short about it. but God is a  holy God that can not the presence of sin. man is born with sin and needs to be cleaned of it to have a relationship with God. the only way to be cleansed of sin is blood. (the Passover story) since man could not pay his own sin debt He sent His Son to die a brutal and terrible death on the Cross. (psalm 22) from there faith takes over where a person needs to believe in Jesus for the payment of his debt. if a person does they are put in a right relationship with God. (john 3:16).as you can see (by the other answers) faith is a hard thing to have. hope this helps.
4	Which is the best Wireless Router for home? Netgear? or Linksky? or Whatever???\n\nThanks alot ! It's actually Linksys (I never heard of Linksky..oh well)..\n\nAnyway, I have had an expeirience with 2 different Netgear Routers, both of which the range was not that great. I have dealt with a D-Link in my home which surprisingly covered the whole yard, over 2 acres (but its flat and the router was on the highest point). So D-Link is good. Linksys is good/fair. I never heard of Linksky though.\n\nAlso, make sure you get a router that broadcasts Wireless G. wireless B is kinda outdated and slower. It might be best to get a Pre-N router too.
0	do you love that living in iran ? yes i love iran and iranian
0	Do you like living in the country or in the city? Why? Well, I grew up in the country and I currently live in the city, and I have to say I like them both equally. \n\nThe country has more space, fresh air, people are more easy going, but a lot of the time you have to drive really far just to get somewhere (ie: My best friend growing up went to my school but she lived three towns over) \n\nBut the city has more services, there's a lot of things to explore, but there's always a lot of people around. \n\nSo really, it's just up to what you're willing to give up for something. I love them both equally, but I would probably snatch up a chance to move back out to the country

8	what do you do when the boy you like, likes your best friend? He likes my best friend and i dont want to get in problems with her..she is really cool but it makes me soo sad that he likes her. He does think im cute but he likes her better There aren't many options for you.\n\nYou have the option of flirting with him to the point that he starts to like you (which is increadibly hard to do) Or you could tell your best friend to 'boycott' him. In other words, the two of you could work together to get him to like only you and not her. She would have to refuse him and if he came along telling her he was in love with her, she'd have to convince him that you were a better pick for him. One way might be to have her completely blow him off. [Which doing a joint effort to get him to like you isn't as hard as it sounds as long as your friend is willing to give him up. (that's what best friends would do)] The thing is though, that in order for it to work, you have to be his #2 choice.
2	how does long term depression and depression medication effect memory and speech patterns? I have memory loss and my speech is getting slurred.  My reflexes are slower than normal. That's interesting that you say that. I know a lot of people have said that's not normal, but I have had a similar experience.\nI am currently recovering from a period of serious depression, and I'm on anti-depressants.\nI have noticed that my memory is significantly poorer than it used to be, I really struggle to remember names  or how to drive to places I've been to a couple of times before.\nMy spelling has been really affected (I mix up the spelling of a lot of words now, where I never did before)\nHowever, I have not noticed that my speech is getting slurred. That does worry me, and you should definitely see your doctor about that.\nI went to my doctor to ask about my memory loss and concentration loss. She said that she didn't think that it was a result of the medication, and the only way to determine if it was would be to stop taking the medication, and she doesn't think that's a good idea right now.\nSo she thinks it must be side effects of the depression, but has no idea how long it will take me to get to normal, or if I will.\nObviously that really worries me!\nI wanted to let you know that you are not alone, but unfortunately I have no answers!!

1	why do rain drops have the specific shape they have?? Everyone says that The surface tension causes the drop to be spherical. But how? and Why?\n\nLets explain surface tension first-\nIn an air-water interface, the molecules that are close to the surface are attracted by fewer molecules of the liquid than the ones that are NOT close to the surface. The former thus, has less attractive potential energy than the latter, right?\n\nNow, for any matter (solid or liquid), attractive potential energy results in stability & repulsive energy results in instablity. Right?\n\nSo, it is energetically unfavourable to have a surface for a liquid (or solid) as it results in loss of attractive potential energy.\n\nNow, for that reason, a drop tends to have the lowest possible surface area to remain stable. Now, using some high level mathematics, we can find out that a sphere has the lowest possible surface area for a given volume. (it is better than a cube atleast).\n\nHence why we can see that the water bubbles and drops tend to be spherical. \n\nBUT, as gravity pulls the drop downwards, it looks like the way it does. Due to the distortion by the pull of gravity, the drops appear somewhat oval in shape but, in the absense of gravity, all the liguid-air surfaces tend to be spherical.\n\nI hope it helped.\nHave a nice day!

1	Do toilets in the southern hemisphere really swirl the opposite direction(of northern toilets) when flushed? No, the swirling is caused by the direction that the water is shot into the basin.  It can be either clock-wise or counter clock-wise in either hemisphere.  The Coriolis effect does not come into play; it depends on how the toilet is designed.  In many toilets outside the U.S., the water is not shot in a swirling motion and no noticeable Coriolis swirling occurs.

8	Is he abusing me? I recently married my hichschool sweetheart. We dated for 5 years before we got married.? He was always shy and calm, but recently he's become more and more violent. He never hits me, but he will hit or throw things. He has also started criticising me, saying I never clean enough or that I am lazy. Also, he restricts my money usage, even if its money that I have made. (Even after all the bills have been paid) He used to be so sweet, and I dont see what has caused the change. What should I do? Yes, that is abusive behavior, and hitting "things" is what Domestic Abuse experts call "Furniture violence" and it's considered a huge red flag...\nWas there anything that seems to have triggered the change? Trouble at work, a death in the family,legal problems, drug or alcohol abuse? If none of that seems possible, he needs to see a doctor...sudden, unexplained personality changes often indicate a medical problem and he should get a complete work-up from a physician.\nIn the meanwhile, you need to keep yourself safe...if he's acting badly, leave the house, put a few days worth of clothes and some cash in a bag at the home of a relative or trusted friend in case you need to leave suddenly.\nContact your local womens shelter for more information on warning signs and options that are available to you.\nIt is NOT your fault, no one deserves to be frightened of what goes on in their own home and you don't have to tolerate it...yes, you promised "For better or worse" but he also promised to "Love, honor and cherish".

9	is it illegal to purchase the book "behold a pale horse"? i want to read it because i heard it contains great info. but my cousin said i'll get in trouble if i buy it? why? It's not illegal to buy the book, but perhaps the contents of the book may be controversial. I haven't read the book, but heres a summary of the "Behold A Pale Horse" from wikipedia.\n\nBehold a Pale Horse is a 1991 book by William Milton Cooper. (ISBN 0929385225)\n\nWritten after Cooper had been a member of the US Naval Intelligence Briefing Team of the Commander in Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, the book details many of Cooper's claims about the alleged influence of UFOs on US government agencies, the New World Order, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the Apollo hoaxes and other topics.\n\nAnother claim made in the book pertains to his own death. William Cooper, seemingly paranoid, claimed that he would be shot to death on his own property. True to his "fate," he was gunned down in precisely this manner years after publishing the book and settling down in Arizona. However, prior to his move, Cooper had confided to a neighbor of many years that he expressed a wish to be involved in a shootout with Federal employees in order to vent his anger about the government.\n\nThe title of the book alludes to a passage in the Bible, Revelation 6:8: "And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him."

4	Is anybody afraid of free stuff re: firewalls, spam detectors etc...on the internet ? Why are they free ? Reason : I have been caught before and gave me lots of problems. So why free and who benefits ? Most of time people are afraid of free stuff via internet because usually they have been victim of scams.\nHowever, there is good free stuff out there. The reason being:\n\n1. Advertising with your consent. Usually ones that are with bad intentions install adware, spyware, tracking software, key loggers, and etc. Good ones are ones that they want you to use their product and promote them by letting others. Good Example of good softwares are,\n\nwww.firefox.com : Less error/issues than Internet Explorer.\n\nwww.openoffice.org : It's same as Microsoft Office, except you don't pay for it.\n\nLinux OS, typically for people who doesn't want to pay for OS software.(I think RedHat Linux, you might have to pay for latest ones)\n\nwww.lavasoft.com : Good adware/spyware removal. Free for personal use.\n\n2. Feedback. Most of programs are tested and runs good, however in order to be tested they need to be run on various type of computer with various components which it would cost the companies sharply high. Best way is give out programs to general people to use and when there's error, it allows people to choose whether or not you want to send feed back data to them so that they can study.(Companies uses the error feedback to study them and fix/optimize their software)\n\n3. Good for the people that doesn't want to pay or poor. People that understands good and benefit of certain programs really can enjoy. Example of that would be using Yahoo messenger/service etc. \n\n4. Sales/Market promotion/Advertisement benefit by spreading programs.\n\nI hope these answer your question. ç=^D

6	Is there a legal way to cancel a automobile finance contract? I cant afford my current vehicle due to loss of income. I am trying to figure out how to get out from under the contract. NO.  You need to realize when you finance a car, the finance company in essence owns the car.  That is why they have the title to it and you don't.  What you need to do is as soon as possible call them and explain the situation.  Most companies will work out something with you to help out for a few months while you look for new income.\nThe only other options you have is to sell the car, or allow the bank to repossess it.  Repossession is the last resort because it destroys your credit and the bank doesn't want the hassle of auctioning the car at a loss.
1	Are creatures other than human dreams when they sleep? Dreaming is a function of the brain during the restorative state of the body... so there is no reason that other animals shouldn't have experiences during sleep just as we do. However, it would be logical to guess that the complexity and creativity of each animal's dreams varies in proportion to its intelligence and mental complexity (hence, humans would then have more complex dreams than parakeets).

3	As the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases? A. the amount of oxygen decreases\nB. the earth's surface feflects more sunlight\nC. there is less ozone in the ozone layer\nD. more infrared radiation is held in the earth's atmosphere D - because carbon dioxide is a "greenhouse" gas. it traps heat.\n\nWhy not the other ones:\nA - I thought the oxygen may decrease, because where is the dioxide coming from if not O2? but then i realized there is plenty of oxygen floating around in different froms, like anything wet. burn the wet stuff and the oxygen gets released (along with hydrogen).\n\nB - CO2 doesn't affect the amount of visible light reflected.\n\nC - CO2 doesn't intefere with the ozone

2	Missing period?? Okay, well... I haven't had my period in over a month.  The entire month of October, I was period free.  I know I'm not pregnant, because I don't have sex.  What does it mean if you go an entire month without a period for no reason?\n\n(But truth be told, an entire month without cramps really is nice...) It could be a combination of things, stress, diet, weight loss/gain, and hormones.  I was the same way when I was in high school, I would go a couple of months without my period (and I was a virgin so I knew I wasnt pregnant) and then I would get it. If it continues you should see a doctor to make sure it's nothing more like a hormonal inbalance. But you will be ok

2	My husband hit me and i'm not sure what to do? we have a healthy relationship otherwise, we both ae well educated andlive a comfortable life, he was really stressed and i told him i would make dinner, but i came home ate from med school and i fell asleep. he feels really bad, i'm pretty mad too.....maybe i should have hit him back.... I know the feeling.  I went to nursing school and my children were lucking to get a home cooked meal.  My youngest father bite the shit out of me one day.  We were together for five years.  I forgave him and that was that.  Then one day he came at me again and before I was able to do any more damage I punched him so hard in the eye he could barely see.  We split up after that.  Then four years later he marries and I was talking to his wife.  Without me saying anything she told me about how she has bite marks all over his body.  \n\nI would give him a second chance.  You are just as stressed out as he is.  He could have walked out the door and bought you guys some dinner.  He should understand that when entering med school there is barely enough time for yourself.  You eat, breath and sleep med, med terms, and everything else involved.\n\nIf he tries again I suggest giving it right back to him.  It will surprise him and get him thinking that you don't allow that.\n\nGood luck in school

8	Where can I find info on my divorce lawyer .. ever reported to the bar for anything in past?  Thanks!? I can almost pin-point when my attorney took a bribe from my husband or his lawyer. We owned a company together. Yes, go to the State Bar sites.  As for the allegation of a bribe, sounds extremely hard to prove and most Bar Organizations won't look at past history as an indication of current ethical violations absent some proof.  You should probably get a second opinion from another lawyer.  Ask some other attorneys who the top domestic lawyers are in your area and that should start to point you in the right direction.  Court personel can also be helpful, if you know any of them.

1	Approximately how long are the skid marks of the car that is going 65 miles per hour? At the scene of a traffic accident, a police investigator must determine the speed of both vehicles. The investigator uses the formula s= sq root 5l where s represents speed, measured in miles per hour, and l represents the length of the skid marks, measured in feet. Approximately how long are the skid marks of the car that is going 65 miles per hour? s^2 = 5L\nL = s^2/5 =65*65/5 = 65*13 = 650 + 130 + 65 (fast reckoning) = 845 feet\n\n---\n\nIn fact I am not so easy with miles and feet:\nI know it by km as they teach in Italy:\nlenght of stop = approx. (speed/10)^2\n\nso\nspeed = sqrt(lenght)*10\nlenght in km; speed in km/h

If you mention references be sure you have their permission to be listed.\n\nThe resume and cover letter only get you invited to the dance. They do not mean you will be asked to dance. The interview is the sell and takes precedence over all.

1	if you have MRNA that reads: GAU then what would be the TRNA? CUA - Since G pairs with C, A pairs with U in RNA (there is no Thiamine in RNA Maverick) and U pairs with A.

4	How does the compact disk save and replay  the information ? I want to know the scientific way that CD's working by .\nWhich material that it's sectors manufactured from , How do we save the information and where ,and how we replay the information into the computer , i mean which sectors are working in CD's and how ?. To understand the answer better, I have prepared a small course on CD's for you. \n\n--How the CD is constructed--\nA CD is a fairly simple piece of plastic, about four one-hundredths (4/100) of an inch (1.2 mm) thick. Most of a CD consists of an injection-molded piece of clear polycarbonate plastic. \n\nDuring manufacturing, this plastic is impressed with microscopic bumps arranged as a single, continuous, extremely long spiral track of data. Once the clear piece of polycarbonate is formed, a thin, reflective aluminum layer is sputtered onto the disc, covering the bumps. Then a thin acrylic layer is sprayed over the aluminum to protect it.\n\n--The spiral on a CD--\nA CD has a single spiral track where data is burned on, circling from the inside of the disc to the outside. It is extremely small - approximately 0.5 microns wide, with 1.6 microns separating one track from the next. (A micron is a millionth of a meter.)\n\n--How things are written onto a CD--\nInformation are burned into the plastic of a CD in the form of small pits, or bumps. The bumps that make up the round track are each 0.5 microns wide, a minimum of 0.83 microns long and 125 nanometers high. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.)\n\nThe incredibly small dimensions of the bumps make the spiral track on a CD extremely long. If you could lift the data track off a CD and stretch it out into a straight line, it would be 0.5 microns wide and almost 3.5 miles (5 km) long! \n\nA CD drive has a laser beam which shines onto the track of the CD and picks up the bumps. The bumps are converted to information that the computer or CD player understands.\n\nIf you want more detailed information, visit http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cd.htm\n\nHope I could help...

0	Why is it that everyone wants peace, but is unwilling to make sacrifices for that peace? When Good men do not act, that is when evil man prevail. If we had stayed out of Europe during WWII we would all be singing the praises of Hitler. (regardless of if we wanted to or not)\n\nIf we stay out of world affairs and allow the Saddams of the world to gain a foot hold, if we dont keep them running; that is when they will rear their ugly heads like snakes. The only reason we have not been hit by Alqaeda, is because the international community has not let Usama take a breath without ducking for cover. Good question.\n\nHowever your question seems to assume that we have to fight our way to peace. Although this is sometimes necessary as in WWII, I don't think true peace will be arrived at by a crushing victory over our enemies. The survivors will still be our enemies. The war may be over but there is no peace.\n\nI think true peace is reached by achieving justice. When everyone is treated as a neighbor, when poverty, famine, preventable disease, and other unjust issues are resolved then we will be on our way to true peace.\n\nThere are not many people who really want to make the needed sacrifices for this to happen.\n\nWith love in Christ.

2	If you punch sum1.......does a really big forearm help?? how.........? wats the use of building ur forearm....?..........wat will help in fiting......jus a quick question......cuz theres this bully who wants 2 fite me........ A good punch is a full body movement. A powerful punch comes more from your legs, shoulders, and stomach, than from your arms.  Get a heavy bag, and just work on punch combos for a week or two.  Don't go full force, because if you haven't done much boxing your wrists won't be able to handle the stress at first.  Do lots of push ups and sit-ups.  Doing push ups on your knuckles will also help get your wrists stronger.  Once you have some speed, then start working on adding power.  A jab is to stun, and its just a quick hit.  When you want to do damage you want to use more weight, and drive the punch into them for optimal damage.\n\nDo like a right jab, left cross, right power, solid left to the body, then a power right to the stomach, as they hunch down from having the wind knocked out of them, just give them a right cross from your elbow. Boom, fights over in about a second flat.\n\nReally tho, fighting should always be the last option.  If you are an experienced fighter, you can do lots of damage with a single blow.  Fights rarely last anywhere near as long as they last in movies, or boxing.  A single solid un-gloved hit to the head will end most fights.... One good hit can cause... Detached retina, broken nose, broken teeth, lockjaw, and even damaged hearing.

2	why is my penis curved upwards? is curvature in the penis normal?  how do women feel about it? Yes, completely normal! Obviously we're not talking corkscrews here but a little curvature is perfectly normal. And I shouldn't think women would bother about it - I certainly wouldn't - I think personality and humour are more important. Anyway, presumably someone that's seeing it already likes you quite a lot anyway. lol. Seriously, don't worry - my boyfriend's goes slightly to one side (although I won't tell him I wrote that down). There have been some interesting studies done in which researchers morphed faces to be more or less symmetrical. The findings were that we like things more or less symmetrical - but not completely - subjects described feeling uneasy when looking at faces that were completely symmetrical. A little asymmetry apparently puts the mind at rest. Maybe it makes us more trustworthy and more approachable?

1	Such thing as De-ionised water? There should be no such thing as de-ionised water. If there are no ions in the water (including H and OH ions) how can there be a pH if the pH of de-ionised water is 7? You are right, you can not completely remove all the ions from water.  The equilibrium of water would just form more H+ or OH- as soon as you remove them.\nDI water is a reference to the fact that it doesn't contain ions other than H+ and OH-.
5	whohit the ball that willie mays caughht? In Game 1 of the 1954 series Mays made one of the greatest defensive plays of all time, a brilliant over-the-shoulder catch of a long drive by Vic Wertz, deep in centre field of the spacious Polo Grounds. The play, now known simply as "The Catch", kept the scores tied. After the Giants' victory, Mays was announced as winner of the National League Most Valuable Player Award and the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year.
4	Wireless Network Security? I just bought the LinkSys Wirless - G broadband router with speed boost and the the linksys Wireless - G USB netwrok adaptor with speed booster. I treied to add security to the network, but it did not work, saying that the adaptor could not communicate with the router. It only worked if there was no security on either the roter or adaptor. So, I finally got it working with just WEP security, yet there is a stronger security available, namely PSK and WPA. So, if WEP is not the strongest security available, what can I do to make the network more secure and stop people jumping on to mine? \n\nI am using a laptop as the main comp. I am running XP service pack 2 on it. I have the ability to set MAC address filtering, (but I don't not know my MAC address, how can I find this out?) I can set a passphrase but trying this stopped the network from working.\n\nAny ideas? Firstly the MAC filter will not keep out anyone who is into spoofing.  But to learn your MAC number, open a command window  and type \ngetmac \n\nWEP is pretty easy to break these days.  WPA is much stronger [for the moment].

0	Are there any men in the U.K. that hate football with the passion that most love it? I am male and have hated football for as long as I can remember! I think football is as arrogant as the statement, "the beautiful game". I am sick of seeing the aggressive, fist shaking, teeth clenching of supporters, totally arrogant. Have you noticed that most news programmes end with a smile and say something like, " and now football", as though they are now going to talk about something that has unanimous approval, arrogant! Even many tv adds are using a football theme. It is as though people are being brain washed with it, it’s everywhere! It appears that football is gaining a kind of religious type of status. \n\nPlease tell me that I am not the only male in England that feels this way, and thinks it is about time that others know that not eveybody loves “the arrogant game”. I don't hate it, I just find it dull.

6	If I have a contract for 24hrs/wk work, does the employer have to pay 24hrs even if they dont offer it? I have a contract with a supermarket for 24 hours work a week, but they have often rostered me for less than this and basically told me its hard luck. Dont they have to pay/offer at least 24 hours or pay the missing hours not offered? Im leaving them today and they wont budge on it. Can anyone please refer me to the relevance Act/passage in employment law that may support this as I cant see it in the 1996 Employment Act. If you read your contract or handbook ther will probably be a section where it says that hours will be offered according to availability and that the company will not be liable if there are not enough hours available. If it doesn't have anything similar you're still not in luck, you have very little chance of ever being able to claim any kind of compensation.

9	Help PLease!!!!? Many critics of the American system of nominating candidates for President contend that voters in Iowa and New Hampshire choose the two major candidates for President (with limited input from voters in other States). Explain this position.suggest some reforms that might be implemented to improve the system. Essentially, this view is based on the fact that the two States have their nominating processes (the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary) at the very beginning. Candidates want to make a good showing here in order to demonstrate that they are viable within their own party. However, I feel it's overstating the case to say they "choose.....with limited input"  Recent campaigns have not borne that idea out. Voters in New Hampshire and Iowa do not, as a rule, represent opinions and concerns of the rest of the country.\n\nViewed as a horse race, which is how the media cover campaigns and elections, these two States do have an inordinate amount of attention paid to them, again only because they come first in the cycle-------they're the only show in town in the early stages. Most years, they're quickly forgotten once the next round of primaries come along.\n\nThinking back, the last time I remember these States  having real impact was in 1968, when Eugene McCarthy got 42% of the N.H. vote in the Democratic Primary to LBJ's 58%, but that was enough of a shocker to cause LBJ to take his hat out of the ring.\n\nThe reality is,not the early state contests but the wheeling and dealing that bring the foregone results at the National Conventions. You have to go back 46 years, to 1960, to see a Convention where the outcome was in any doubt.
1	HOW MUCH IS 18.25 MILLION DOLLARS WORTH IN A BANK THAT PAYS 5% INTEREST BE WORTH IF IT'S  YEAR 1848 TO NoW THIS IS THE AMOUNT THAT USA PAID MEXICO FOR THE LAND AT THE TIME IN ORDER TO BE FAIR AND GIVE THIS BACK HOW MUCH WOULD THEY OWE US . I believe the equation for solving this is:\nS=P(1+i)^n  where S is the amount after n periods, P is the initial Principal and i is the interest rate.  Therefore S=18,250,000(1+.05)^(158)\nassuming annual compounding.   The answer is (drum-roll) $40,660,440,000.

2	can you take a prescription from an existing pair of glasses? I don't need a new eye test as the glasses I have are perfect, just the style is out of date. the eye doctor can look at your glasses and tell you the prescription that they are so you can get a new pair.  or, if you pick out a new frame that will fit the lenses you have, you can have them trimmed to fit and that way you can save some money as you won't have to buy new lenses.  but, if it's been more than a year or two, the doctor may have you take a new exam anyway.  i have to do it every year to get my contact perscription refilled even though the scrip hasn't changed in over 5 years.
3	When someone calls my cell phone but I am in another city how in the world does the call find me? My daughter called me on my cell phone while I was out on the highway in another state 300 miles from her home. How in the world did the call locate me when no one knew where I was? When you turn your phone on it reports your phone number (registered in your sim card) to the nearest cell tower.  From there, your carrier's nation wide network routes your calls similar to how the internet works.

9	For victory to be declared in a war, does it not mean war must hav been declared by both parties involved? How can any one have victory when the country of Iraq was "invaded" and no war declared. Victory over what? Ideologies, religion, people, a theory, or a decomocratic government based on western ideologies which appear never to work in Islamic societies. You are comparing apples to oranges. first off, Japan never had a formal declaration of war against the US. They just sneaked in and attacked us.  Because the Islamic ideology is different, and that a radical group can and does control a vast majority, only proves that if one of the Imams openly said " go to America and begin killing infidels", there would be more immigrants coming across the border just to kill Americans.

Talk to your dentist to see if they have any kind of payment plan, there is a dental credit card out there called care credit that you can apply through your dentist.
8	Why bother having children and giving them a home? It makes no sense to have children; if when your children grow up, they feel you are meddling with them in their lives when they marry and have children.  How are this generation going to react when their children have children and they are told that they have no rights. And that they are meddling, but hand over the money and baby-sit or you are a bad grandparent! Most USA children have become disrespectful to parents when they feel they have grown up and get married.  Who got you to where you are?  And why should we, as denied grandparents, leave an inheritance to you when in fact you deny us our legacy and our grandchildren their heritage? Who do you think you are to tell your mature parents to get lost? Or to tell your spouses parents to take a hike? Good question, most children growing up now have no respect for their elders. Something to do with the parents of the peroid I would imagine.
3	which degree is higher, a certificate or associates? Typically an associate's degree is higher, but in some fields the certification is what is required.

Otherwise, you have to use intermediares.\n\nThe question is which one? The only ones are those who can count on doing continuous business with you. They may ask for big fees and it also depends on the amount. Ask the receiver how it could be done.

9	The world resourses are limited. Does that mean rich people are robbing what should be shared among all of us. LOL.. No, that is not how it works. At this time we have an abundance of natural resources. More than enough for everybody to have a decent standard of living. In fact we waste more natural resources worldwide than we actually use. The poorest nations being often the biggest wasters. \n\nThe concept that all should just be instantly shared with everybody has allure for the scared and desperate. The lulling thought that you will always be taken care of. That some devine fairness will magically appear in a species which has always in the past had to work so hard to establish fairness and justice. Hate to bust your bubble but it aint going to happen. People are people and communist systems like that breed corruption even faster than other systems. Think about it this way. You have a computer, which is something the majority of the world doesn't.  Should they not chop up the parts in your computer to pay for food in a nation that used to produce excess food until a corrupt Government took over and destroyed the agricultural system?  Should you be responsible for the mistakes made in another nation which you personally and your nation had nothing to do with? \n\nIn reality barter/trade is the fairest system we've yet devised. Taking something away from somebody will only instill hostility and bitterness. It doesn't make the person you give it too any more wealthy. It just makes all poor. Instead of some being miserable all are miserable except for an elite core which replaces the rich with an even deeper and less challlengble elite caste. So in the end all your suggestion accomplishes if it were implimented is to remove all chance you personally have of gaining wealth. It will make life even less fair. It will make the poor poorer as redistribution is both an incentive not to produce and costs resources which means there is still less left to go around. \n\nYou want to help the poor then help them learn self sufficiency and fight corruption wherever you find it. Corruption is the main cause of poverty. It is injustice embodied. A bribed politician is the cancer of civalization.

3	i dunno if i should e-mail my old teacher? ok, in 6th grade i had the greatest teacher ever. and i havent seen or talked to her since the last day of 6th grade so its been just under 3yrs. i barely found my old elementary school website a few minutes ago and i can e-mail my old teacher from the web site  but i'm ebarressed to send the e-mail. she rly loved/loves her students so should i send the e-mail to just say hi i think she mite like that or should i just not worry about sending it? i know it's dumb but im cunfused so should i or not? \n\nthanks for any advice Only you know best what's good for you and her because you were her student. But if I were you, I would DEFINITELY go for it. I'm the kind of student (now a high school freshman) who has been blessed enough to have several teachers who have made a positive and significant difference in my life. And I told them about it, and it's just a great experience and relationship. You just can't have that kind of relationship with anyone other than a teacher, because, like any other relationship, all are difference. I would definitely do it. Don't feel embarassed. Write what you feel. Don't try to make it sound professional -- this is an old, favorite teacher of yours. If she really is a favorite, you should feel comfortable enough to feel like yourself around her. Trust me, I would do it -- teachers love getting that kind of thing, you'll feel better that you did it, and maybe you could make a difference in each other's lives. And if you're unsure of how to do it, it's like what my all-time favorite social studies teacher has been telling me lately, "Just do it."

What if someone wanted her to get them, like her husband. I suppose he wanted her to be classified as a tramp. Grow up penis breath.........
0	How do I remove blood stains from cotton clothes? Go to the supermarket and get a bottle of stain remover spray. I use this whenever I have blood stains and it 'bloody' works.

6	do you think that individuals who file bankruptcy or are over their head in debt are immoral? Do you think that individuals who have credit cards, but can not pay more than the minimum payments (which means they can not pay back that debt) or all individuals who have ever filed bankruptcy are immoral? Interesting question here. Just curious what others think? Immoral? Filing for bankruptcy was the hardest thing I ever did. People get into debt for various reasons - divorce, illness, poor money management, easy access to credit and numerous other reasons. Filing for bankruptcy involves quite a bit more than walking into a trustee's office and signing some papers. Sometimes life doesn't go according to your plans and filing for bankruptcy is usually a last resort, not a question of morality. It's not "taking the easy way out" at all. Why morality would even enter into decision to claim bankruptcy is beyond me. How easy it is to judge someone in that position; just hope it doesn't happen to you one day.
5	funniest thing you ever saw? what was it? mine was when Newcastle bummed sunderland by scoring 4 goals in 20 minutes. i giggled. The funniest I saw was in a local league.  A substitute had taken his track-suite off (it was a freezing cold day) and had been waiting for a considerably long time for the ball to go out of play before the substitution could take place. Eventually when the time came for him to go on, he said to the ref "about f***ing time I'm f***ing freezing".   The ref turned to him and showed him the red card, and said "all right son you can get in the shower and warm up"

2	what is the cance of me   haveing hypoglycemia? that depends. does anyone in your family have diabetes or hypoglycemia? true hypoglycemia is rare. more often then not people abuse thier bodies by eating crap and then get surprised when their blood sugar crashes after eating that crap. or people go without eating for extended periods understress and they crash and also assume its hypoglycemia. any and all hypoglycemia is diet controled. usually having a piece of fruit or some other high fiber low gi food every hour prevents me from getting the shakes. if i get the shakes its not very long until i go into shock if i dont have something to increase my blood sugar. my grandfather has diabetes and i inhereted hypoglycemia from him. if you suspect you are hypoglycemic go to your doctor. they can find out for sure.
1	omega-3 has the first carbon bond at the? The omega-3 family of molecules are polyunsaturated fatty acids, which means that they have more than one double bond in the carbon chain.

The Democratic congressman who will investigate the Bush administration's running of the government says there are so many areas of possible wrongdoing, his biggest problem will be deciding which ones to pursue.\n\nLiberals...Lets help Henry...\nWhich Republican investigations should he pursue lst? First look into the real reasons why Donald Rumsfeld did the "Cut and Run".\nTrust me, there's more to that story than what meets the eye. This above all the other indiscretions, will lead us to the BIG ONE. This will most likely give us the reason why the Bush administration has had private talks with Henry Kissinger (Nixon-Watergate era) in the last couple weeks.

0	Has anyone heard of a Selkie?  I need some more info on them, some bases to work off of them.? Somebodies had to have written about them before?  Name the book?  Article? Selkies (also known as silkies or selchies) are mythological creatures in Irish and Scottish mythology that can transform themselves from seals to humans, where "selkie" is simply the Orcadian word for "seal". The legend apparently originated on the Orkney Islands.\n\nSelkies are able to transform to human form by shedding their seal skins and can revert to seal form by putting their selkie skin back on. Stories concerning selkies are generally romantic tragedies. Sometimes the human will not know that their lover is a selkie, and wakes to find them gone. Other times the human will hide the selkie's skin, thus preventing them from returning to seal form. A selkie can only make contact with one particular human for a short amount of time before they must return to the sea. They are not able to make contact with that human again for seven years, unless the human is to steal their selkie's skin and hide it or burn it.[citation needed] The Grey Selkie of Suleskerry is a ballad typical of the former, while The Secret of Roan Inish is a movie telling the latter tale. "Seal Child" is a children's novel by Sylvia Peck which details a modern telling of this myth.\n\nMale selkies are very handsome in their human form, and have great seduction powers over human women. They typically seek those who are dissatisfied with their romantic life. This includes married women waiting for their fishermen husbands. If a woman wishes to make contact with a selkie male, she has to go to a beach and shed seven tears into the sea.\n\nIf a man steals a female selkie's skin, she is in his power, to an extent, and she is forced to become his wife. Female selkies are said to make excellent wives, but because their true home is the sea, they will often be seen gazing longingly to the ocean. If her skin is found she will immediately return to her home - sometimes, her selkie husband - in the sea.

2	want to be a size 4? I am exactally 5'2. I have lost a lot of weight.When I was 158 my hips were 40 1/2. I want my hips to be 34 inches.Do you think then if I lose 30 lbs from 158 my hips would be 34. I know I needed to lose a lot more fat from that area. any tips of what 2 eat and not 2 eat to lose stomach weight too?\nthanks\nbtw I am 24 year old female. Right now your body mass is 29 which is really unhealthy. The weight you should be for your height is 112.  You should try to eat healthier and eat small portions. Also do alot of cardio and pilates,yoga. Cardio excercises burns lots of calories and pilates and yoga will make you more flexabile and also give you the lean look that you are looking for. But you have to keep yourself committed. To start out try to excercise 3x a week for 20 mins. Then when you get yourself into a rountine you can start for 6x a week for 45 mins to an hour but dont start to hard on yourself cause that wont be good for you. Also make sure you get alot of water cause water cleans out your body.If your still real hungry after a meal try guzzling some water and chewing some gum. The water will fill your stomach and chewing the gum will distract you from trying to eat more food until your stomach settles with whats in it. So goodluck hope you achieve your goal.

6	How to get a personal loan for low interest (sometime, without any interest)? I am in need of a Personal Loan of US $ 1000/- only.\nI can give a reasonable guarentee and assurance.\nKindly let me have a reasoble and accepted interest rate.\n(If possible, free of interest).  I can give proper guarantee to the party.  Please contact me on mh mobile : 00971502243765.  My e-mail : jabarsadiq@hotmail.com\nThanking you in anticipation. I have recently heard about savings secured loans, which use your savings account as collateral.  It is one of the best deals around, because at the end of the loan period, you still have savings.  It works like this:  you pay a particular amount to the bank (usually a credit union), say 5% for the loan; in the meantime, you earn interest on your savings account, say 2.5%.  When you pay off the bank, your savings is freed up, and you have really only paid 2.5% interest for the loan.  The only drawback I can foresee is if you don't have any savings to begin with.

3	Where can i learn and get information on Poverty in Africa for my research project????????? Charity websites are a good source, such as Oxfam, UNICEF, The Red Cross, Live8, Make Poverty History, etc. You can find these with google.\n\nFor facts and figures, such as average income in each country, number of doctors per head of population, etc, there is the CIA World Fact Book, written by the US Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nWikipedia, the online encyclopedia, has an entry on poverty, including links to more topics and external websites.\n\nYou might think about all the basics of life that we have and they don't, then look up each one in wikipedia, in combination with the word Africa. For example, water, food, shelter, health-care, disease, clothing, etc.\n\nYou could also lookup 'africa' in wikipedia, look at the list of countries and read the entry page for each country to see what their particular problems are.\n\nIf you need to write something on the CAUSES of african poverty, think of all the things that stand in the way of a succesful economy :-\n\nWar (often caused by colonial powers leaving africa divided into countries with several tribal groups that hate each other)\n\nTropical diseases and HIV/AIDS\n\nTrade-barriers (tarrifs and quotos), so that many goods they want to export to the rich countries are too expensive.\n\nPoor credit history, so they can't get loans.\n\nCorrupt/Undemocratic governments.\n\nLack of education.\n\nThe fact they are joining the industrial world 200 years behind the USA and Europe.\n\nLack of clean water and sanitation.\n\nEnviromental damge.\n\nDroughts and other natural disasters.\n\nHigh crime in some countries due to the easy availability of guns from previous wars. This scares off international investors.\n\nLack of phone and internet access.\n\nPoor roads.\n\nHuge distances to sea container ports, through several countries.\n\nDesertification.\n\nThe fact that many other countries see Africa as one place and ignore the whole continent as somewhere too dangerous to invest, when in fact it is many different countries. Think how different Egypt is from South Africa.

1	Biotechnology - an exciting new job oppurtunity or a legislative time bomb? What are your thoughts.? Its a relatively new field, but is it really going to last, despite all its potential? I hope so since I have a Bachleor's in Biotechnology. Right now the job market is very good, but like Stephanie said science jobs pay very little, I know that better than anybody. :( \n\nIn regards to if it will last that depends on what field of biotechnology you are refering to. From the way you worded your question I am assuming you are talking about the more controversial areas and I'd have to say since this country is so conservative that will probably continue to stand in the way of our advancement in the scientific field. This is unfortunate because we will probably find the U.S. falling behind the rest of the world in this aspect.
8	How do you go from seeing someone to being in a committed relationship? How do you go about asking about being exclusive? Just let it happen naturally is how.  If it's meant to be that's what it will turn into....and will do so w/o you really realizing it.  Just enjoy getting to know him and take it slow.  I know that can be hard to do when you really like someone but taking it slower and getting to know eachother will build a much more solid relationship.  Just because you've not had some big talk too doesn't mean he's seeing someone else. Who says he's dating around?  Bet you have nothing to worry about! Don't dare try to have that "talk" either.  Just let him do the chasing and have fun with you're together.  If you start hinting/asking him about being exclusive you're gonna not only get on his nerves but drive him away as well.  Just let nature take its course....Live and enjoy!

7	what is the name of and who sings this christmas song (partial lyrics included)? This song was played on the radio probably around 1990 but I have been unsuccessful in finding who sang it or what the same of the song is (or where I can find it to hear it again).  I believe it was song by a young school girl in Baltimore, but I have no basis for that other than a vague recollection.  \n\nThe lyrics/refrain went something like this:\nYou can keep the toys dear Santa, / cause they're not on my list /\nit isn't very long this year cause i only have one wish. / \nSee, Mom and I are all alone and we're here on our own. /\nSanta can you bring my daddy home?  \n\nI don't think it ever has been produced, which I find surprising.  Maybe this year it will make a comeback.  Thanks for your help. it very well could have been a local song there in balmer...

3	Should we educate the uneducable???? I need this question answered to finish an A/B project so if any answers or comments please write back as soon as possible!!!!!! I need your help with this!!!!!!!!! There is no person on this earth that cannot learn.  If you have a student with cognitive disabilities, you have to choose what is most appropriate to teach them, life skills.  You would not teach a child who will never fully comprehend text to read a book, but to recognize those words/phrases/signs that will enable them to live their lives. An example would be a bus schedule or sign that says poison. You give them the opportunity to be part of a community by helping them go to the public pool to swim or go bowling with a group.
1	i stretched a piece of plastic. why does it form wrinkles on it? is there some logic behind? membrane structur I am trying to experiment and find some structural principles regarding membrane structures or tensile fabric structures. i tried with plastics and found wrinkles when stretched, but cant find a reason behind it. can someone suggest something? If I understand your question: Wrinkles can generally form when the material is in compression - it is a form of buckling, so try looking up 'buckling' or instability as a topic.  Plastics are not isotropic and exhibit different properties in different directions.  (Metals, in contrast, can be isotropic, but are subject to Poisson's ratio and exhibit different behavior depending on "plane stress" or "plane strain" conditions.)\n\nPlastics for the most part are not true crystalline solids; they are viscoelastic materials with properties of directionality depending on previous processing.  For most all plastics there will be some degree of creep under tensile stress.  Relaxation of the tensile stress allows the elastic component to retract in the opposite direction of the applied tensile stress, but the plastic component (the permanent set or "visco" component) won't contract.  Meanwhile, the stress direction at 90° to the tensile stress has likely experienced less stress and so has a larger or more elastic component.  What this means is that as the tensile component exceeds the yield point, the cross direction has not, and may have a tendency to buckle in the cross direction.  It also depends on how you're holding onto the plastic when stretching (biaxial or uniaxial?).  \n\nSome plastics have a strong tendency to align their molecules when stretch, and become more 'crystalline' in nature.  You can see this effect by 'stress whitening' when stretching a plastic grocery shopping bag made from HDPE.\n\nThis is kind of a complicated materials engineering question requiring a little more detail into the stress state, the exact material, even the environmental conditions play a role (how warm is the ambient, humidity level, etc.)\n\nHowever, for the most part, try looking up 'buckling' because that topic may give you more insight into why the wrinkles form.
2	After a crash diet or fasting, do you gain all the weight back even if you try to eat healthy afterward? Do you gain MORE weight back? Yes, and more.  By crash dieting (using the definition of extreme caloric restrition) you have convinced your body that it needs to store any energy it consumes rather than use it to power the body.  In other words, you have told it to get fat.  \nThat is why eating 6 small meals a day is the best for losing weight.  As an example, if you are a normal healthy adult female you need about 1200 cals a day on average to power your body.  So eat 6 small meals of 200 cals each (good cals, NOT candy bars!) with protien, dairy, fruits and nuts being your focus and you will lose weight (providing you burn 1200 cals!) because your body will see that you have enough food to survive and it does not need to store the energy rather than conserve it.

2	Can a man join Curves gym? And if not, how do they get away with that? I'm sure  legally a man is permitted to join, however it is so highly discouraged that I doubt the gym has had to deal with it. You could ask the local curves about it or contact headquarters.
2	Is there any long term heath issues associated with eating donner kebabs?? No absolutely not. It's my favourite.\n\nDöner Kebab (as döner kebap in Turkish and often simply kebap, döner, doner or donner.), which literally means "turning roast" is the name given to a Turkish dish made with lamb (or mutton), beef or chicken. A version developed to suit German tastes by Turkish immigrants in Berlin has become one of the world's most popular fast food dishes. It is essentially the same dish as shawarma and gyros, possibly differing from them in the type of meat and spices used.
2	My scalp is always numb when I wake up. What's wrong with me? I think I have cervical spine problems; my scalp and tongue go numb when I sleep and this indicates that I'm pinching a nerve somewhere; I also have visual migraines sometimes...I went to a very uninterested neurologist who concluded that because I'm young, nothing's wrong. Could I get brain damage if the nerves in my head keep getting pinched when I sleep? Has this happened to anyone else? PS, I don't have cancer or a tumor or Multiple Sclerosis. Try a chiropractor.  Also try to eat a more alkaline than acid diet:  less protein and cooked foods, more raw fruits and vegetables.\n\nDry skin brushing will help with all-over circulation:  http://healingtools.tripod.com/skinbrush.html  Be sure to use a different brush for your neck and face than for the rest of your body.  And make sure it's a natural bristle brush, not one of those plastic things.\n\nNiacin helps to bring blood to the surface of the skin.  You may need to eat more foods high in niacin:  foods high in protein, like meat, eggs, and peanuts.  B supplements need to be taken in balance.  If you can find an herbalist in your area, they can help you find a combination B suited to your needs.\n\nI hope this helps!  I can't imagine how stressful that must be.

3	how can i sleep and make sure that i will see a dream? Keep a journal beside your bed. When you wake up and recall a dream, write the dream down immediately. You'll notice your recollection ability start to increase.\n\nSet your alarm to go off every three hours. (may not be the best way to spend the night, but if you want to try this on a weekend...)  \n\nWe dream during REM sleep. Most of us probably dream two or three times at least, but never remember any of it. If you wake up immediately after REM sleep, there is more of a chance you'll remember.

How good is Nash equilibrium solution as compared to the other globally optimal solutions In Game theory you don't have to start with a lot of plausible scenarios and then go selecting the best one. You build up from a few initial assumptions. In terms of computing, that means reduced memory requirements.

1	BEGGING U TO TELL ME THIS PLZZZ>>>does copper prevent stink in shoes>>>>>>? ANSWER THIS PROPERLY PLZZZ AND I WILL GET U A BEST ANSWER:) Like silver (used in socks), copper could be used as a biocide to limit fungal growth which causes the stink.  Unlike silver, copper would have side effects and would react with sweat and humidity, mostly oxidizing and turning things blue.  This would limit or eliminate copper's usefulness for this purpose.

1	How can i find the sum of this series? a(n)=(1/(2n-1))*(1/(A^(2*n-1))...\nS(n)=a(1)+a(2)+...+a(n)=???? If I understand this right, you have a(n) = A^(-2n + 1)/(2n - 1), so\n\nS(n) = 1/A + 1/(3A^3) + 1/(5A^5) + ...\n\nLet f(x) =x^(-2n + 1)/(2n - 1) = x^(-1) + x^(-3)/3 + x^(-5)/5 + ...\n\nThen f'(x) (derivative of x) is\n\nf'(x) = -x^(-2) - x^(-4) - x^(-6) - ...\n\nThis is a power series and can be summed over the range it converges as -x^(-2)/(1 - x^-2), then you need to integrate to get the actual function.

4	How can I transfer Cassettes to MP3 with Music Matc, Winamp or freeware, step by step instructions? easiest way to transfer cassettes to mp3, is to simply use a stereo to stereo lead from your cassette player and hook directly to your pc, then you can use a sound program (simple voice recorder can do it) and record the sound into a *.wav format (simplest format there is for audio, quite large file), then convert the wav file into mp3\n\nnot sure what program to use off top of my head, but i reckon music match would be able to do it

5	What is the real difference between a Tasco Riflescope and a Leupold, other than image clarity? I want to know if in reality a cheap scope will affect so much my rifle accuracy to spend $500 - $1000 in a scope.  If they are really so bad what is the difference.\n\nRemember I'm not talking about image quality that I know will be better in a more expensive scope but for Bench Rest Shooting this is not as important as accuracy ( Shoot to Shoot repeatability) Two main differences, both related:\n\nOne, the Tasco scopes usually have 1-inch main tubes and many (most?) Leupolds have 30mm tubes. That extra 5mm means extra elevation adjustment before your stadia (the thing that holds the reticle) hits the side of the scope.\n\nSecondly, the Tasco has two adjustment knobs; one for elevation and one for windage. But the configuration is like this: One knob at 12 o'clock, one at 3 o'clock, and one spring at 7:30 to press the stadia against the adjustment knobs. It's a common configuration, but it means that as you adjust the windage, the elevation can change as well. Leupold uses 2 springs placed 180 degrees from the adjustment knobs - so a knob at 12 and 3, and a spring at 6 and 9. It makes the scope more repeatable as you make adjustments.\n\nIf all you want to do is sight in your rifle at, say, 200 yards and then shoot a deer or two a season, the Tasco will do just fine. if, however, you're dinging clay pigeons at 700 yards with a quartering wind you'll want the scope that can perform for you.\n\nA really simple test of a scope's adjustment mechanism is to shoot a 3-shot group at the center of a large piece of cardboard - right at a target dot. Then move your windage a few minutes of angle to the right - I like to move it 6 minutes, or 24 clicks on a 1/4 moa scope. Place the reticle on the same target dot, and press the trigger 3 times. Now adjust your elevation 6 minutes up and repeat, then 6 minutes left, then 6 minutes down. You should have a perfect square defined by the 5 groups you shot, with the group in the lower left being 6 holes and the others being 3. If you have anything but a square, or your ending group isn't at the same place as your beginning group, your scope has a repeatability problem when adjusted.
7	how do you get backstage passes? can you buy backstage passes to concerts? or do u have to be invited? Several ways.\n\nYes, sometimes they are available.\n\nIt helps.\n\nBackstage passes are provided to people who work the show, and also a certain number go to radio stations, the promoter, the caterer, employees of the venue, friends of the road crew, and some friends of the performers.  Additionally, sometimes backstage passes have restrictions on where backstage you can go.

9	law on drug reports? if you get reported to the police for drug use.. if you dont have anything on you or at ur home but have it in your system, is that enough to get you in trouble? and can the police drug test you or search ur house if someone makes a complaint. Yes it can. If you are intoxicated in a public place or under the influence of alcohol or narcotics you can be arrested for DUI, DWI, or Public intoxication. If you are a danger to yourself or others or are considered a mental risk you can be taken into custody also for your protection. If a friend is at your home and sees Narcotics in plain view and they are a credible witness a search warrant can be obtained and your house searched and you subsequently can be arrested for what they find if it is in the warrant or not. An example would be your friend saw you smoking marijuana and you have a bag of it on your table. If your friend has given credible information before to the Police then they are proven up to be credible and a warrant is very easy to get. If a police officer is responding to a call at an apartment complex and your window is open and he/she smells you smoking a joint and looks in the window and sees you he no longer needs a warrant because in his/her training they have been trained to recognize the smell of burning marijuana and that is probable cause enough to snatch you up and hold you until a warrant can be obtained and if they can see the dope in plain view they don't even need the warrant.

0	What do single mom's or low income families need to put themselves in a better position besides money and God? I want do establish a faith based program to help them. Please only reply with serious answers.  Thanks Change of attitude!  \n\nI believe that we live intentionally and our decisions  are a reflection of the beliefs we have of ourselves. \n\n I have known women who seem to attract men who are not good husband or father material--yet they choose to be with them and have babies with them.  All species are attracted to the best of their kind--the strongest, fastest etc.  It is natural to want the best traits to be passed down in your offspring.  \n\nSome women do not pick the best because they do not think they deserve the best.  \n\n  Also, I have know both men and women, who are always in dire circumstances because of their attitudes. People who have a a better opinion of themselves would be sad and frustrated in situations of bad circumstances, but would use the occasion to grow--not self-destruct.   \n\nMoney problems are not fixed with money.\n\nDr Phil and Suze Orman believe that money problems are first resolved by 'fixing' your beliefs and habbits.\n \n  Dr Phil once said that if I took all the money away from people who have it and give it to people who do not have it, within a year the people that had money taken away would have some. The people who had money given to them would lose it again.  I have witnessed this time and time again. \n\nMy advice--a mentor/education program with a strong support system. \n\nEducation is power and giving people the tools to develop their skills and make them economically viable to take better care of themselves is a tremendous gift.  Also made them aware of opportunities, so they can make a choice to take advantage of them.  \n\nThe mentor program can exposed people to possibilities beyond their wildest dreams; where there is a change of enviornment so they can pick up the influences of people who are proactive about succeeding and living a better life, not just struggling day to day.  \n\nRemember--if you give me a fish, I will eat for a day. If you teach me to fish, I will eat forever.

8	why are women embarassed when you tell them you spotted them on yahoo personals' when they put there? they must realize they are bound to be spotted by someone they already know in the neighborhood It's like announcing to the world, "hey I'm desperate". Most girls are already insecure. Pointing out their desperation on yahoo just makes them even more insecure. \n\nWhen you recognize a girl in person, don't embarrass her. Instead be smart and use the info to realize she is out looking as well. So if she starts giving you some lame excuse about her boyfriend, etc. then you know she is lying and is not interested in you.

3	Who is Menelik II and why is he so important? MENELIK II [Menelik II] , 1844-1913, emperor of Ethiopia after 1889. He was originally ras (ruler) of Shoa (central Ethiopia). After the death (1868) of Emperor Tewodros II, Menelik, with Italian support, gained strength steadily. He seized the throne after Emperor Johannes IV died. In 1889, Menelik concluded the Treaty of Uccialli with Italy. When he learned, however, that the Italian version of the treaty made Ethiopia a protectorate of Italy, he denounced the agreement. The Italian invasion that followed (1895-96) was crushed by Menelik's great victory near Adwa . Italy was forced to renounce all claim to Ethiopia and to pay an indemnity. Menelik took important steps to strengthen and modernize his domain. He made Addis Ababa his capital, constructed a railroad, attempted to end the slave trade, and curbed the feudal nobility. His conquests doubled the size of the country and brought the present S Ethiopia (largely Muslim in population) into the realm. Gradually his health failed, and the end of his reign was marked by intrigue and maneuvering for the succession. He was succeeded as emperor by Lij Yasu.

Government run entities are insufficient, but they can't do worse than what Big Oil has done to us.\n\nIn Venezuela, gasoline costs 20 cents a gallon.  That is its free-market price, although economists, who are highly paid to come up with excuses for petrobandits, can convince suckers that the real market price is $3 a gallon.\n\nA government of a free people has the duty to provide necessities such as water, roads, police, etc. at a not-for-profit price.  Gasoline is such a necessity.  Because we, the people, have eminent domain over the economy, we can and must confiscate private companies that have abused their free-market privileges.  The oily stockholders have looted us long enough, so they should not be compensated if we make their shares worthless. You assume that "we, the people" have control of our own government.  We don't.\n\n\n"American democracy is a conspiracy of special interests against the general interest, but every special interest thinks that it is the general interest."\n- Michael Kinsley\n\n\nHint: Health insurance is uglier.

0	What do you think of this Christian infomercial? Not too long ago, I was flipping through channels on my TV. I came across an infomercial on one of the religious channels which stated that Christians would be fulfilling Biblical prophecy if they paid for a Russian or Ethiopian Jew to immigrate to Israel. Don't get me wrong. I know that the Russian and Ethiopian Jews have it rough, so I don't blame them for wanting to go to Israel. However, the Christians weren't being encouraged to help them for altruistic reasons. I remember a Christian woman on the infomercial saying something like, "The Bible says that anyone who helps Israel will be blessed, and I want to be blessed." And remember, they want to help fulfill Biblical prophecy! Whatever happened to helping people just for the sake of helping them? And why do I doubt that the same people who would donate money to this program would be likely to join a group like, say, Amnesty International? I think that this infomercial is very offencive

2	Why is a part of my skin extremly sensitive and painful to the touch? On the back left corner of my head(neck), kinda where my hair ends. I have short hair by the way, and i'm a male. Anyways, there is this little area around the size of maybe a quarter where it is extremely sensitive and hurts even just to touch it. When I even rub the hair above it, or when I turn my head all the way to the side, that area begins to hurt.\n\nI cant describe this pain, possibly like the feeling of a sunburn. But there is no rash, redness, lump or any sign of irritation on or around the area.\n\nI am on accutane by the way, that could be a side affect since accutane has many skin related side effects. But whether it is or isnt, what is this pain called and is it anything serious?\n\nIve googled it up and some had felt it on their waistline and other parts of their lower body and they said it was the shingles. But could it happen even on such a small area on the back of my head? Shingles can appear anywhere on the body in a small area or all over.

1	What is liquid pressure and Pascal's law of hydraulics? Application of pascal's law A liquid is said to be in equlibrium when no net external force acts on it.But in equlibrium condition its molecule as always are in random motion.These hav some maas and hence momentum(mxv).If now we assume an imaginary surface in liquid.These molecule collide with the surface an hece momentum change.Rate of change of momentum is force.And force on that particular area is Pressure(F/A).This pressure is manifested as liquid as liquid pressure\nPascal law states that if external pressure is exerted on any part of liquid then it is equally transmitted throughout the liquid.suppose we consider 2 points at same depth(at same depth pressure is equal).Point 1 has surface area A and 2 has surface area B,then if F force acts on A(i.e.Pressure=F/A) then this pressure will be transmitted to 2.since area of 2 is B so force experienced be F'(pressure=F'/B).Now mathamatically \n            F/A=F'/B
9	conversion? what is the legal terms for this word a noun:  a civil wrong (tort) in which one converts another's property to his/her own use, which is a fancy way of saying "steals." Conversion includes treating another's goods as one's own, holding onto such property which accidentally comes into the convertor's (taker's) hands, or purposely giving the impression the assets belong to him/her. This gives the true owner the right to sue for his/her own property or the value and loss of use of it, as well as going to law enforcement authorities since conversion usually includes the crime of theft.

9	Are the undocumented workers inherently bad persons? The real issue at hand is: should there be immigration? The answer is a resounding yes. America is a nation of immigrants, and unless you're the great grandson of Sitting Bull, you are of immigrant origin. Immigration is what gives strength to this country: where do you think George Washington and Lincoln came from, spontaneous combustion? What about Einstein? Furthermore, while many sit around and complain about immigrants, the US is the country with the most transnational corporations in the world, which means we derive a great portion of our wealth from doing business abroad--so I think we can take a few immigants from those countries in which we do business. Mexico happens to be our fourth largest trading partner which means a lot of Americans have jobs because Mexicans are buying our products. \n\nAlso note that a lot of Americans are staffing the branches of US transnational corporations in other countries. For instance, Japan is the country with the second largest population of Americans (after the US, evidently, and excluding Iraq and Afghanistan were American populations are in theory temporary) and Mexico is the country with the third largest population of Americans.\n\nIt's true that it would be good if Mexico could provide enough work for its own citizens, but the fact is that it cannot do that yet; as neighbors the US and Mexico need to sit down and work together to find a solution. Building a fence will not even help; we'll probably have to hire immigrants to help us build it!\n\nSeparately, someone claimed that immigrants come here to take advantage of Social Security and our welfarte state. In fact, statistically speaking, it has been proved again and again that immigrants work hard enough to earn their Social Security, just like any other worker in America. In addition, it's also a statistical fact that there are more Americans on welfare than immigrants; illegal immigrants do not really have access to it, since they are not US citizens and cannot receive it.\n\nIn sum, everyone has gotta cool down and think rationally. Blaming the immigrants for whatever is ailing you today, is nonsense. George Washington would surely not sympathize with you, nor do I.
3	what is balancing equations? if you mean in chemistry, it refers to making sure that there is an equal amount of mass on both sides of the equation, so that none is lost during the reaction. all of the matter has to somehow get through to the other side, even if it winds up being a different state of matter (such as a solid precipitate being formed, or a gas given off.) if you need more help ask a teacher.
2	Why do I break out when I shave? Every time I shave with a razor, I break out in acne. It seems like electric razors work better but they don't give me as close of a shave. I'll bet you have curly hair too.\nYour problem is likely in-grown hairs.  \nYou know how the commercials say the razors shave below the skin?  Well they do.  When the hair tries to grow back out it grows under the skin (which happens more often the curlier your hair is), and gets irritated and you get a zit.  Clean a large pin or a needle with alcohol and free up the ingrown hairs when they get painful.  The only preventative solution is to not shave so close.  Stick with the electric and don't press too hard.

1	What year was the Leaning Tower completed? It was 1360.. according to source.\n\nAlso, look at this time-line\n\nYear\n\n1173 Commencement of works on 9 August of the \n     year 1173. \n\n1182 Establishment of the "Opera Campanilis petrarum \n     Sancte Marie" (Stone Works of the bell tower of \n     Saint Mary). \n\n1185 Probable interruption at the height of the 4th \n     order. \n\n1198 The presence of a bell-ringer at the Tower is \n     documented - a sign that the building can hold \n     at least one bell, partially fulfilling the \n     purpose for which it was intended. \n\n1231 Building work, probably taken up again in the \n     first decades of the century, proceeds. A \n     workshop in which marble for the Tower is \n     worked is documented. \n\n1233 Oath of the worker Benato Bottici: in the \n     ceremony of investiture he pledges to be \n     "solicitous and attentive in the building \n     of the bell tower of the church, according \n     to the means of the Opera". \n\n1260 Giovanni di Simone, whose presence was \n     documented at the Opera del Duomo from 1260 \n     and, from 1267 as master builder, intervenes \n     in the construction of the Tower. Building \n     proceeds up to the seventh order, where a \n     correction of the axial inclination of the \n     building is made, which is no longer \n     rectilinear, having assumed a concave form. \n\n1278 Further suspension of building work. \n\n1292 Giovanni Pisano measures the inclination \n     of the Tower with a plumb line. \n\n1360 After almost a century of inactivity, \n     Tommaso Pisano completes the construction, \n     erecting the belfry and making the last \n     important geometric correction of the structure. \n\n-The End-

Some do, though, which has been nice to see.

7	how do you tune a violin? It depends if you are playing solo or with a piano accompaniment. If you are playing solo, you would use a tuning fork (440 Hz)to tune your "A" string. Then, you would use your "A" string as a reference to tune the other strings. The strings on a violin are "G" "D" "A" and "E". Basically, the pitch of the strings is in ascending fifth. You want to try to tune to a perfect fifth: ie. "G and D" "D and A" and "A and E". \n\nWith a piano accompaniment, you tune to the A above the middle C on the piano. And use that as your reference.

3	I want to enter my son to good school but have no money, how can I get help? I want to give my son better education which concerned about the talent in each kid and appreciate the kids as they are, develop their ability, but I dont have much money. My son is not a winner whom could get a scholarship, by the way he is still in second class in primary school. I'm a single parent who want to give the best for the my son. Where I could find help? You son sounds like a good candidate for a federal grant or loan (I'm not a big fan of loans, but its still an option if you want to take that road). He should definately fill out his FAFSA application and see what is available. Also, there are millions of scholarships out there not only based on a specific talent but other criterias as well, so I wouldn't be too quick to count those out. Your son should definately talk with his guidance counselor about his options and even talk to a college recruiter as they have a wealth of information to give too. Hope that helps!

It seems like life sucks, but you need to talk, and try and direct yourself, find something you enjoy and engross yourself in it.  Me, I love to play music and dance.  When I'm in my music mode, nothing can get me out of it unless I want them to.  Talk to someone, sweetie, life is GREAT, we all have our ups and downs, just need to have help when we're at the low points.  Talk to someone.  I'm praying for you.

4	How to get past URL hiding schemes by understanding how Domino UIDs or other numbers are created? I'm trying to create a lyrics application that will download lyrics from various web-sites, but there is only one web-site that has not hidden the lyrics they have under different schemes.\n\n The one web-site which has a clear URL scheme is www.lyricsdirectory.com which goes something like this\n\nA standard format for lyricsdirectory:\nhttp://www.lyricsdirectory.com/index/FirstLetter/BandName/BandName - SongName lyrics.htm\nFirstLetter being the first letter of the band's name, BandName being the band's name, and SongName being the song's name.\n\n Others, like Sing365.com utilize Domino Unique ID hexadecimal numbers in their lyrics URLs.\n For instance the link to Bush - Macinehead would have a 32-bit UID after it:\n\nhttp://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Machinehead-lyrics-Bush/0000000000000000000000000000000\n\nAll I want to do is create a third party application, crediting the web-sites that give the lyrics, which brings it all together but most of these web-sites use URL hiding.

You win the bet, your husband loses!\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, it's official. The Sopranos is finished after this upcoming season which begins March 12th.\n\nDavid Chase, creator and executive producer of the HBO hit series, assured critics Friday at the Television Critics Assn. winter press tour that he won't be coaxed back for more after the 20 episodes he is working on are completed. "That will be the end", Chase said. "Definitely".\n\nThe previous season of Sopranos was intended to be the final episodes, but HBO managed to lure Chase back for more. Twelve new episodes unspool in March, followed by the final eight episodes in January 2007. Chase even scotched the perennial speculation that HBO could produce a theatrical version of the show.

5	Who would be the defensive player of the year besides Big Ben Wallace? Why? Well, I guess you could look at a guy like Andrei Kirilenko or Bruce Bowen once again.  I might even look at a guy like Ron Artest, but you're right, Big Ben is the class of the league defensively.  I personally like the interior defense of Elden Brand quite a bit, but he gets a lot of help from Chris Kamen and his team defensively isn't as consistent as the Pistons, who were 17th in Field Goal Percentage Defense this year by the way.

2	Anyone out there got any tried and tested remedies for MS related fatigue? Have tried Amantadine, Pregabalin, Prozac.  Am 27 having my 2nd relapse in 18 months, part time nail technician (more like a hobby ) full time Bank Manager.  Been off sick now for 11 weeks and fatigue no sign of letting up.  Consultant wants to try beta interferon, but am reluctant!!! Greetings!!!  Fascinating question!!  As someone who has been successfully managing the symptoms of MS for over 45 years - R/R for the first 40 of those years, and now Secondary Progressive MS - my answer would depend on what "causes" your MS fatigue the most??? \n\nAs you know, MS fatigue is far and away DIFFERENT from "normal human" fatigue.  AND, each person's MS symptoms are different.  With this as background, I'd offer the following.\n\n1)  Determine your "optimum" activity stage within each 24 hours.  For example, for me I start to go to sleep about 2 - 3 am, and sleep until noon or 1 pm.  My most productive time is 11 pm to 2 am.\n\n2)  Determine your main "cause" of fatigue.  For me, it is interacting with others; any physical activity; and the clenching of my muscles.  For this, I swear by Baclofen, which is a muscle relaxant!!!  AND, I "manage" each day to maxamize my ability to get done what I need to do.\n\n3)  As for taking beta interferon, it's DOCUMENTED success in "decreasing the rate of increased MS exacerbations" is great!!  AND, the greatest successes come with folks like you, who are caught early.  Unfortunately, when I went on Avonex in 1997, it was really too late for me, and, even though I took the shots for 5 years, my symptoms had "solidified" so that I was no longer within R/R, and there are currently no meds for SPMS.\n\nHere are my qualifications for providing you with these answers, and information about the current "best" meds for each MS symptom.\n\n1) I've successfully managed the symptoms of MS for over 45 years.\n2) I was an HR Executive for over 30+ years, and combined my professional and personal expertise in creating a website dedicated to assisting folks with "chronic disease symptoms" better document, communicate, corroborate, and manage their symptoms and the resulting impairments to become expert patients; chronic disease self-managers; and, partner with their doctors to practice patient-centered health care.\n\nhttp://www.disabilitykey.com\n\nMy website contains tons of information in 2 blogs, downloadable free articles and self-help ebooklets, and the Disabilitykey Workbook which contains over 100 pages of how to processes and actual forms - blank and completed examples - to assist folks. This workbook is available for a very small price (under $10).\n\nHere's a blog that I did that discusses not only the top 22 MS symptoms, but what - at least a year ago - were the top medications used to help you better manage those symptoms. The reason that I like this list of symptoms and their associated "management aids" is that precisely because MS has so many symptoms, you may need to take some time to do some "introspection" to figure out which TYPE of symptom do you haave!! For example: do you have "plain vanilla" fatigue, or do you have depression coupled with either pain or fatigue? The management aids for the 3 different "types" of depression are different; so, the more precise and specific you can become shen documenting both your symptoms and how they impair you so that you can better inform your doctor, the better your doctor can assist you with symptom management!!\n\nSo, your Doctor tells you that you have a disease. You know that you have symptoms that impair you in your every day life, but you want your Doctor to give you something to make the pain/symptom go away!\n\nWhat is the best medication for your symptoms, for your illness? Remember, only your Doctor can help you. However, the better informed that you are about what is out there, the better you can discuss alternatives with your Doctor(s).\n\nThe following information comes from the National MS Society website. Now, most disease medication lists start with the brand name first, with the SYMPTOM that it is to address almost as an after thought. BUT, we, the patients, start wit
0	marijuana reaction? I think its really interesting how people react to marijuana. For some they get "high" and for others it makes them paranoid, or creative. Alot of people say that they didnt feel like they though they should after smoking it. I believe that the effect physcially will relax you and anything that else goes on its really all just in your head. If it makes you creative..then thats just your own jsutifaction for being creative. what are you veiws? Marijuana is classified as a depressant.  This is an oversimplification.  It has many depressant effects, like the relaxation you refer to, but it also stimulates the brain's frontal lobes, where "executive thought," or "higher order processing," occurs.  This means that the area of your brain where you do most of the thinking that you're aware of is stimulated, so you're going to have more thoughts than usual flowing around up there.  Some people are mentally strong enough to use these thoughts constructively, and we call this "being creative."  Some people cannot control their thoughts, and we call this "being paranoid."  Some people can usually control their heads, but in certain situations, cannot.  So the subjective experience is different for every person, every time.  \n\nI had a creative writing teacher once who discounted all drug stories.  "You don't really know if that's insight, you were just high, and that was just a drug thought," she would say.  She was completely wrong.  You get to take credit for every positive thing you do on drugs, just as you are responsible for every mistake you make, high or sober, as if it makes a difference.
9	THE TERRORIST WAS KILLED    Al Zarqawi  ?? Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (Arabic: أبومصعب الزرقاوي‎) (c. October 1966 – June 7, 2006) was a Salafi Muslim terrorist leader and the self-proclaimed leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. One or more individuals identifying themselves as Zarqawi took responsibility, on several audiotapes, for numerous acts of terrorism in Iraq, including the killing of many civilians and the taking of hostages. He was also allegedly responsible for many other acts of violence, including the beheading of hostages (possibly including Nick Berg) in Iraq.\n\nAs an Islamist identified with the Salafi movement of Wahhabism, Zarqawi opposed the presence of American and Western military forces in the Islamic world and opposed the West's support for Israel. In September 2005, he reportedly declared "all-out war" on Shia Muslims in Iraq,[1] and is believed responsible for dispatching numerous Al-Qaeda suicide bombers throughout Iraq, and especially to areas with large concentrations of Shia civilians. As the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq he is suspected of causing thousands of people's deaths--many if not most of them civilians.\n\nZarqawi, a longtime ally of Osama bin Laden, was a high-ranking member of bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, and since October 2004 had referred to his own organization Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, or Monotheism and Holy War Group, an insurgent network operating in Iraq, as "Al-Qaeda in Iraq". On October 21, 2004, Zarqawi officially announced his allegiance to Al Qaeda; on December 27, 2004, Al Jazeera broadcast an audiotape of bin Laden calling Zarqawi "the prince of al Qaeda in Iraq" and asked "all our organization brethren to listen to him and obey him in his good deeds."[2]\n\nZarqawi was the most wanted man in Jordan and Iraq,[3] having participated in or masterminded a number of violent actions against United States, Jordanian and Iraqi targets. The U.S. government offered a USD $25 million reward for information leading to his capture, the same amount offered for the capture of bin Laden before March 2004. On October 15, 2004, the U.S. State Department added Zarqawi and the Jama'at al-Tawhid wal Jihad group to its "list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations" and ordered a freeze on any assets that the group might have in the United States. On February 24, 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice's FBI also added al-Zarqawi to the "Seeking Information – War on Terrorism" list, the first time that he had ever been added to any of the FBI's three major "wanted" lists.[4]\n\nZarqawi was killed in Baquba by a United States airstrike on June 7, 2006

0	If God created Adam and Eve, then where did everyone else come from without incest? Whether you believe in Adam or Eve or that man descended from some primitive Ape-like man, at some point there had to be incest.  Mankind has 46 chromosomes.  Apes have 48.  If mankind resulted from a genetic mutation, there still had to be incest within the first few individuals in order to propogate this mutation.\nIncest is only wrong in that it can cause mutations which are recessive to be displayed.  Incest is therefore forbidden in order to prevent birth defects and aberrations.
8	Why do I always get hit on by girls, I don' like?...Why can't the girl I like do the same?....? Since we are in the same situation as you stated in the answer you submitted the other day.  I can tell you my side of the story and why I think this young lady does not approach you.  Ok, so you both know that you like each other and from the looks of one of your posts well I can see that religion interests you.  So, let me take a wild guess and see if I can decipher the reason why the one you like does not approach you.  She probably is religious as well and you may see her once in a while, maybe through a gathering or something like that.  You guys exchange a nice “I like you gaze” and then just continue to live, if no gaze then at least you try to say “Hi!” acknowledging each others presence.  She may not look depending on the situation she does not want to be too obvious, but she likes you, yes she does.  Have you thought that maybe, just maybe, because you both do not interact (talk, communicate) she may be afraid to approach you. The fact that you guys do not talk may even be the one cause that is alienating her from you.  Why? Because she thinks well maybe he is not interested in me.  Another thing if she does approach you why not ask some questions about her to get to know her better.  I think she is waiting for you to make the first move.  I am traditional person I prefer the man to make the first move.  Maybe she is also the same way.  You also have to make reference to culture, maybe in her culture the male is the one that makes the first move traditionally.  It means that he is interested in forming a relationship other than friendship with her.  You are like singling her out of the crowd and by asking her out you show her that you are serious about her and about this union.  I am pretty sure a friendship between you two is nonexistent; it is just pure “eyes” and “Hi’s” (since we are in the same situation).  Personally if I were her I would continue to wait for you to make the first move, since she likes (loves) you.  She probably has liked you for quite some time, maybe even years (I have liked him for years; it is only now that I am closer that I am trying to show him that I like him).  One more thing I saw in a movie over the weekend you know it was Valentines Day and well I said why not and I got this great idea.  I would ask a good male friend of his to encourage the one I like to ask me out or to get close to me.  See to what great lengths one goes just for a person you like (love).  I have not done anything yet and probably would not the idea seems a bit shaky.  I am glad that my question at least has helped you in your situation.  I pray that the Lord give you strength to get closer to the one you like (love).  Just do it! I know you will not regret it.  It is probably the best decision you have ever made in your whole life, I guarantee it.  Thanks for your advice, but I will wait for him, I have put him in Jesus hands. Let me know what happens. God bless you Mod!

Did you find anything cool?  also if anyone is here living in springfield mo, would you consider getting a dumpster diving group together? Absolutely. And my wife and I used to go garbage picking in various neighborhoods the night before garage pickup. We've gotten all kinds of good, resaleable things. Such as a wine cart, book shelves, expensive electric typewriters, more things than I can even think of right now. It got so bad, we've had to quit, because we don't have room for everything. A good place we found to dumpster dive was behind a local Kmart. We've gotten a power saw, drills, flowers, plants, books, bags of dog food, cat food, lots of unopened potato chips bags, gum, health food bars, etc.. that had just recently expired. \nThe funniest time (looking back) was when I was in a dumpster and it started raining, I had trouble getting out, then it started to lightening, and it was amazing how I managed to fly out of that metal dumpster. My wife, who was watching, thought it was hilarious.

7	Who is Pete in the phrase "For Pete's Sake?"? Here is an explanation from The Phrase Finder supporting the Saint Peter hypothesis:\n\n: : What is the origin/menaing For Pete's Sake?\n\n: Biblical origins. Think of St Peter. Think of the omnipresent medieval church and think of hitting your thumb with a hammer. You can't swear, else the local priests will have you up before the Bishop and the Lord alone knows what the outcome of that will be, so you exclaim, in appropriate tone of voice, "For Saint Peter's sake" and carry on erecting the shelves. This phrase was amended to "For Pete's Sake" in later, less religiously oppressive, times.\n\n: This is called a "minced oath," a substitution of a less offensive word.

The stupid idea of "You can't get an ID without an ID". Try to explain this to them and ask THEM for their opinion on your situation. Most of the time they are helpful and will point you to the right direction.\n\nI had a similar situation with my husband. He had an old expired ID from another country and that country's consulate wouldn't give him an ID, the DMV wouldn't give him an ID. SO, we just asked the DMV what we should do? They suggested official school records, you request them and keep them sealed and let the DMV open them. They just want to make sure it's you. Hope that helps!

For the last 3-4 years we've given all our time to the kids and forgotten each other. She told me that she felt unloved and alone in the relationship and that now she needs to be alone to figure things out. Could she be overwhelmed with everything, she works two jobs was going to school and all the house work cause I didn't help much plus the kids... Could she be going to some kind of crisis? Is there anyway I can get her back and save our marriage?\n\nWe have 2 kids 10 and 8 years old, she says she knows she is destroying my life the kids life but that she still needs to be alone. She also said that if she starts to miss me that this could be a good sign! How could she not miss me for the last 15 years we've done everything together with the kids! seems like the two of you have grown apart, you need to dedicate time to each other, go on dates, reconnect without the expectations and responsibilities you currently live with...counseling may help...but be prepared, you simply may have fallen out of love...good luck

Apply the same temperment towards your relationship with frinds and foes.  Another importnat attitude is freely move with society and frinds, without hurting any one, and controlling your hard feelings (and avoid expressing it)and don't do outright criticism.  Even mind control and Yoga may help.  Try to be like a 'good snake'that hisses but does not bite.  Last but not least is that dont get envy / jealous looking at others success.\n\nI used to be like you, and even more depressed than you.  But I am changing for good.

Mexico's government is deeply flawed. Canada's government borders on not being entirely a Democracy- their senate is appointed and representation in their lower house is not proportionate to their population. \n\nAnd opening the south border to Mexicans to come and go is such a crazy idea... that it might just work.

You believe in gravity, don't you? You believe in sound, and wind and that the sun will come up again tomorrow, don't you? You can't see any of those things, yet you believe in the effects of them! I have just as much faith in the fact that there is a Grand Creator and that He loves me. I think He is pained by all the wickedness and hatred He sees on earth, but if He interfered, the issue raised in the Garden of Eden regarding the ability to choose for one's self as to right and wrong would go unanswered. Satan told Adam and Eve that mankind could rule himself and choose for himself, and he would not die, as God had said.  God has given mankind all this time to A) prove to himself that he cannot rule himself and choose wisely as to right and wrong and B)to prove that there are those among humans who WOULD serve God out of love. God will make all as it should be after Armageddon, when a New World Order is here on earth and man has the chance again to do what Adam and Eve lost the chance to do..live forever in a perfected state on a perfect earth.

0	In a religious veiw is oral or anal sex wrong even if your doing this with your spouse? Me and someone  were talking the other day and how this subject came up I have no idea and she told me it was a sin to perform or recieve oral sex and that it was a sin for your husband to do his wife anally. Is it considered sinfull in a regious point of veiw to have anal sex or oral with your own spouse and your spouse only? Yahoo Answers may replace or*al sex with ***'s in this answer, but I hope it will help you.\n\n________________\n\n\nIs Oral Sex A Sin - What Does the Bible Say?\nCouples often ask, "Is oral sex a sin?" The best place to look for answers is in the Bible. Hebrews 13:4 says, "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral." The first point the Bible makes very clear is that sex - all types - is designed specifically for married couples. Non-married couples are not to practice premarital sex. \n\nThe Bible never indicates exactly what a husband and wife are allowed to do in their sexual relationship. However, there are some sexual principles that we can consider. \n\n\n\nMutual Consent - 1 Corinthians 7:5 says, "Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control." This verse indicates that each sexual activity should be mutually agreed upon. \n\n\nAdultery is Sin - The Bible is very clear that any form of adultery is sin, even if both people in a marriage relationship agree to it. 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5 says, "It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the heathen, who do not know God." Adultery also includes "swapping" or adding sexual partners. \n\nViewing Pornography is a Sin - Matthew 5:28 is very clear. "But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart." Pornography viewed alone or together as a couple is sin. 1 John 2:16 says, "For everything in the world - the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does - comes not from the Father but from the world."\n\nIs Oral Sex A Sin - Practical Application\nWhen answering the question "Is oral sex a sin," it is important to remember that God created sex to be a beautiful expression of love for married couples. When the husband or the wife does not feel that sex is a "beautiful expression of love," then changes need to be made in that couple's sex life. Evidentially, the actions are not mutually beneficial to each person. Nothing in the Bible says that oral sex is a sin, however it may not be appropriate for every couple. \n\nIs Oral Sex A Sin - Questions to Consider\nConsider these questions when answering the question "Is oral sex a sin?"\n\nIs oral sex voluntary and have both the husband and wife agreed to it?\n\n\nWhy do you want oral sex? Is it for pure sexual pleasure or is it to fulfill a sexual fantasy derived from porn?\n\n\nHave you or your spouse been convicted by the Holy Spirit that oral sex is wrong?\n\n\nDoes oral sex edify and fulfill both you and your spouse?\nWhile answering these questions, pray for guidance from God. He will reveal the answer to you - for your relationship.
8	I always thought that faithfulness is not in human nature.. what do you thinK? One can't have sex with only one person all his life... it's really confusing me. Your right. You'll always be attracted to the opposite sex, unless your gay, but you have to have self control when your married. If you don't have it you shouldn't be married or find someone else who wants an open relationship. I know a couple that's been together 16 years and they have sex with other people as long as they get to meet that person. I think it's odd but it works for them and noone's lying or doing anything behind each other's back.
9	Doing jail time? I friend was given the sentence 2 years with half. And he is at a L.A. county but they will be moving him to a state prision in 2 weeks. He has already did a month about how much time will he do hey right now my husbands doing time in a state prison it sucks but about your friend if they have where they can work day for 2 days then he wont be surving the full sentence although there is a such thing as a judicial release basically he has to serve 30 days in state prison no jail no correctional facility he has to be in prison for the 30 days then his lawyer can file a judicial release but that means he could be on parole for like 5 years,or house arrest.Most of the time at least where my hubby is the judge is a bitch and on top of that a dyke so shes pretty hard on men and hasnt gave a judicial in like 10 years although we filed i even wrote a letter to the judge but  did me know good im sorry to hear about your friend i know it sucks but if they did the crime they will do the time but i would check into the judicial realease what was the charge anyways casue that also plays a big part if he is harmful the society they wont even consider it until a parole hearing has come up and about appealing it you better have damn good evidence as to why he shouldnt be there and be able to prove his innocence cause if you appeal it and the judge still finds him guilty they can up his time it all depends on the judge i hope my advice helps you good luck and tell your friend to hang in there it will go by fast is it there first time being incarcerated i know my husbands not going back he dont belong in there hes not no convict well he is now but hes nothing like the people there murders,child molesters shit like that thats sad he got caught with a stolen 4wheeler and got 6 months but the good thing about it he gets out on my b-day jan. 15th i cant wait ok well good luck

6	Why were fraternities ever created? I am writing a paper for a class, and I was wondering why fraternities were created. Were they to teach men things about life, or was it for friends? I am curious. Thanks for the help!! Fraternities are very old, so it is hard to tell why they were created.  I would say brotherhood (sisterhood for sororities)  Greek organizations exsist today because it is a college tradition dating back to the 1700's

0	Are you for&#92;against have babysitter (or housekeeper) in your home? If you are for or against Give me 3 arguments(reasons) with some details,please!\nEverybody need theme,but are you for having babysitter (or housekeeper) at you house ,or againt...??? I have always been uncomfortable with housekeepers in my home. I have not had any in the past, and here are 3 reasons:\n\n1. I do not like the idea of someone rummaging through my personal belongings. It is a creepy thought to know that someone will be touching and moving my things.\n\n2. I am afraid that my things might get stolen or damaged. Even a housekeeper with the best intentions may be confronted with a situation in which he/she may need money. How can I be sure that he/she will not steal from me? Again, I know not all people are thieves, but that is a risk I do not want to take.\n\n3. I like to clean my own house so that I can be reminded of what I do have and do not have. Notice that I did not say I enjoy cleaning my house, but I do like it because it means that I have a house of my own to keep neat and tidy.\n\nThese are my 3 reasons why I am opposed to having a housekeeper, briefly stated, of course. :o)

6	Copyright / patent ideas? How does one copyright or patent an idea to protect yourself from someone stealing it? *Noddling for I've had to look into this more than once* KK as far as current standards for things like music, images, ect, basically if you can prove you have the files, recordings, ect to create it, it is yours.\n\nNow for the laws on registration, http://www.copyright.gov/\nMany artists, writers, and musicians mistakenly believe that the creator of a work automatically owns the copyright. That's not always the case. Exceptions to the rule occur when a work is created by an employee in the course of his or her employment, or if the work is created by an independent contractor and qualifies as a work "made for hire," or if the creator has sold or transferred all rights attached to the copyright.\n\nYahoo has an area that talks about the topic here http://sbs.smallbusiness.yahoo.com/resources/subCat.php?mcid=4&scid=26\n\nNow pretty much everwhere you go, even straight to the patent office they want a fee, the trick is to find the lowest available fee if you go that route.\n\nNote though, the courts have changed since "Poor Man's Copyright" was created, the practice of mailing yourself a sealed registered letter containing the originals is not accepted in the USA...
8	Why duane tell everybody our business.? when we have an arugment he have to get people involed. When most people do that, they are trying to find people who will side with them to prove they are in the right. It makes him feel good for others to say "man, you were right, she's wrong". I bet he wouldn't tell people if those people sided with you everytime yall fight. He'd get tired of hearing he was wrong.
8	Why do men use these words? I personally hate it when men use the words "hot" or "cute" to describe women.  It shows a very limited vocabulary and shallowness.  I know all men and me are shallow but why show your hand so early in a conversation with a woman.  PS I for one will walk away from a man who uses these terms to describe me. You are right, it shows that their vocabulary is limited.\nHowever the media, mainly pop records has made it acceptable to restrict ones own use of words. I consider it to be demeaning to womankind. Will the pendulum swing the other way or will the use of truly descriptive words go into further decline to suit the lowest common denominator?

2	is there physical exercise for pennis enlargement? Yes, actually there is.  What you need to do is firmly grab the head of your penis with thumb and index finger.  The lightly pull outwards for 5-10 seconds about 5 times a day.  What this does is allow the skin to stretch, also making the 3 canals of your penis that fill with blood longer, thus increasing, over time, the length and possibly girth of your penis.  Now bear in mind that you NEVER, and I repeat NEVER, want to pull too hard on your penis.  This may lead to serious damage, and may harm your penis.  Don't try and make yourself stretch an added 5 inches overnight, it's not going to happen.  This is something that will take time, but it will work, you just have to be patient.

6	Why do some companies give out dividends and some do not? I have noticd even high profit companies dont give out divdends and some do..or vise versa, a low profit will give out nice dividends......why does a company not choose to do dividends and is it possible the could start doing it? Does that ever happen? Some companies choose to reinvest their profits to make their company grow. Companies that do not give out dividend can and do start giving them out, either as special dividends or regular dividends. Just a little while ago, Microsoft gave out a huge dividend as a one-time deal. If a company does not give out dividends, you make your money when you sell the stock. Any retained earnings should increase the value of the stock.

I am just ready to see Chef Ramsey punch Tom in the face with some bread dough or something:) The men's team is pretty shitty. I think that they are going to mix it up soon though, and put the remaining men with a some of the women....
3	What does being a "prep" exactly mean? Isis is partly right. The word is "preppie." It means being in a clique of students in a public school (or in a private one), who are going on to college, as opposed to those who may not be. It comes from "preparatory school," which is usually a private one. Other cliques in a public school might be jocks (athletes) or goths (weird, dark-dressers). Preppie carries the meaning that the person is richer and/or more socially important than others. Some years ago, a young man caused the death ofa young woman in Central Park, New York City. It was called the Preppie Murder Case, because he was in a private preparatory school, and he claimed that she died because of "rough sex." So the word "preppie" carries a lot of emotional weight.

So lets have a fair fight!\n\nGive me your POLITICS!\n\nThe Election begins... first and foremost as your president I would put a cap on how long you can receive welfare.  and when you get a job you have to pay back what you "Borrowed". second, I would do away with "three strikes and your out". if you committ murder, rape, molestation, etc you automatically get life.  Third, everyone who reaches the age of 65 and eligible to retire will automaticall receive "FREE" health insurance.  Our eldery have done their part and they should not have to pay for their medicines and wonder how they will eat.  Fourth, Any person entering illegally will not have the luxury of applying for a temp. work visa, temp. social security number.  someone said once, "NO SOUP FOR YOU!" and thats exactly what you will get.  Why we hand out these benefits knowing they are illegal is just defeating the purpose.  By continuing this we are taking two steps forward and one step back.  Get here the right and legal way or don't come at all.  We understand the hardships you go through in your native country, but..quite frankly, we are not your native country and we have laws for a reasson.  and we all know priests do not become pedaphiles, pedaphiles become priests so they can engage in their sick behavior,  you will no longer be just "fired" and sent away to therapy.  You will be going to jail, I hear they have really good "therapists" that share your cell.  Prison sentence of "LIFE" in most states means 25 years, but LIFE will now be until you draw your last breathe.  We will no longer interfere with other countries and how they handle their business, if they choose to run themselves down or quite frankly, blow themselves up well...what ever floats their boat.  I like so many others am tired of the B U L L S H I T, so help me, help you stop pickin' up other people's  CRAP!

9	anyone know about the radical replublicans? i need to know northern viewpoint, former slaves viepoint, and southern viewpoint of the radical replublicans I took a class on the Radical Republicans (Reconstruction, actually, but they played a big part in it).  Simply put, the South thought of the Radical Republicans as occupants.  They took over the Confederate States and ran them as territories: military governors and strict laws.  The former slaves considered them saviors.  They instituted laws directed at helping out their freedom, to a point.  There were a lot of empty promises made by these Republicans, but it is no surprise that almost all former slaves registered as Repulbicans.  The north is where most of the Republicans came from.  For more information on the northern view, look for anything regarding Andrew Johnson's tenure in office.  For the former slaves and southern perspectives, look for information on Reconstruction or the Hayes' election, which ended Reconstruction.

Finally, King Charles with 3000 horse was reported to be travelling from Worcester. Lord Levin and the Scottish Army retreated and on September 4th, Charles entered the City. Colonel Scudamore was knighted immediately and the city was given a new Coat of Arms. \nThe ten silver saltires or crosses, depict the Scottish Army encircling the City and the buckles on the collars of the supporters are taken from the arms of the Lord Leven.

1	What r the physiological effects of ethidium bromide poisoning? Two years back my friend consumed etidium bromide when she was working in a lab orally and intra venous it was a suicide attempt but she survived nothing can be seen from out side she didn’t informed anyone. Now she is getting pain in the pelvic region and joints and a small bulging in the arm where she injected the needle now she want to live but afraid of this past incident is it will cause any health problems in her life please help is it will cause any birth defect if she had a baby? Please please help Ethidium bromide (EB) is an intercalating dye extensively used to induce demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) (1). Demyelination follows the disappearance of neuroglial cells, chiefly astrocytes, in the early hours of intoxication (2,3). The death of astrocytes makes a breach in the glial-limiting membrane through which Schwann cells invade the CNS and repair the lost myelin sheaths (4,5).\n\nNaked axons receive new myelin sheaths built by invading Schwann cells and remaining oligodendrocytes - the latter along the unaffected living tissue (2). Morphological recognition of the new sheaths is based on the thickness of the sheath and on the presence of a Schwann cell wrapping the axon and surrounded by a basal lamina associated with collagen fibers (1).\n\nThe peripheral nervous system (PNS) differs from the CNS in fundamental aspects, i.e., histological composition (6) and regenerating capacity (7,8). In addition, Schwann cells are considered extremely industrious (9) and highly resistant to a broad span of spontaneous and experimental injuries (10). The aim of the present study was to observe Schwann cell reaction to local single and multiple EB injections and to document peripheral nerve responses to multiple challenges with the drug in order to validate this intoxication as an experimental model of demyelination in the PNS.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\nThirty-four adult Wistar rats of both sexes were maintained in individual polypropylene cages, with free access to ration and water. The rats were divided into five groups and submitted to intraneural EB injections (Table 1). Two animals from each group received an intraneural saline injection. Stance, gait and social behavior were recorded daily.\n\nDemyelination was induced by single or multiple injections of 1 µl of 0.1% EB in 0.15 M saline along 8 mm on the middle third of the left sciatic nerve. The multiple injections were made at 28-day intervals. All injections were made with a Hamilton syringe and the animals were anesthetized with fentanyl/hypnomidate (Johnson & Johnson, São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil). The localization of the lesions was facilitated by a stitch in the adjacent semitendinous muscle.\n\nThe rats were sacrificed by an ether overdose and samples of the sciatic nerves were removed. The samples were collected 7 and 15 days after injection from the rats that received a single injection (group 1), and 10 days after injection from the rats submitted to multiple injections.\n\nThe samples were cut into three transverse fragments for light and transmission electron microscopy studies. All samples were washed with PBS, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer for 48 h, post-fixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions, and embedded in Epon 812 resin. Semi-thin sections were obtained with a Reichert Super Nova ultramicrotome with glass knives, stained with methylene blue and observed under a Meiji 2000 light microscope. Thin sections were made with diamond knives, stained with uranyl and lead salts and studied under an EM10 Zeiss transmission electron microscope operated at 60-80 kV.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nResults \n\nThe rats injected with EB did not show any changes in either stance or gait during the experiment.\n\nThe localization of the lesions was facilitated by the stitch on the adjacent semitendinous muscle although a mild thickening of the epineurium was visible to the naked eye. This thickening was due to collagen proliferation observed in all lesions. Although some variation was detected, most of the lesions were 5-8 mm in length. All lesions showed segmental demyelination and extensive remyelination by Schwann cells.\n\nAfter intraneural injection of EB, Schwann cells showed signs of intoxication with a vacuolated cytoplasm and rejection of the mye

3	should there be a ban on child-aimed TV ads?  Why? yes they should ban many of them.\nthe argument really simply is that children are to young to understand the potential harm and brainwashing of advertising. most kids TV stations have adverts that actively encourage the child to nag their parents for the product and encourage the child to behave badly if they don't get what they want. it is done very subtly so many parents who aren't actively watching the programme, which is the most common (kids in one room with TV, parents in nearby room or doing something else in the same room)don't notice the adverts message.\nIf an adult does not like an advert or isn't interested in the product they ignore it. it is not as simple for a child.\n\nMany of the large food and drink companies in US have realised that if you can, through adverts alone, get a child to associate fun and happiness with for example McDonald's then that child, into complete adulthood, when tested, will subconsciously want to eat McDonald's if they feel sad.

7	Thinking of traveling to L.A for Labor Day weekend,does anyone know what is considered the strip? For instance in Miami,Fl South Beach is what's popping. What is L.A hot spot. Are there any hip-hop clubs or beaches near the clubs and hotels? Also are they inexpensive? SUNSET STRIP...located in Hollywood.\nIt's a stretch from Highland to la cienega.\nClubs normally range from 15 to 20 dollars.\nI'm not sure about hotels. There is also Hollywood blvd, and they both aren't that far apart. Actually, where one ends the other begins. so it's really convenient.

8	Am I being used? For people with a similar experience. I recently dated this girl who has a beautiful baby girl. The baby is not mine, but I would love her as if she was. This girl was dumped by her x when he found out that she was pregnant. I met her at a friends house and we hit it off. She would invite me around regularly to visit her at her house and we had a great time just me, her and her baby. We laughed joked and had fun. Then her landlord decided to sell the place and she needed to move out. She does'nt have a car so she got a lift to work with a freind. Her freind could no longer offer her the lift service because she had moved in with her best freinds parents. I then offered to take her to work and drop the baby off at the sitters she accepted. Once she was in her new reidence it became very hard for to see her again. I saw her for ten min in the morning while drivingand ten min at night when I dropped her off. when I asked her to do something with me she brushed it off.\n\nIs she using me ? I think that she may be using you....and maybe she feels guilty thats whys shes brushing you off. Sorry buddy but say you cant drive her to work anymore unless she starts paying you gas....but say you would like to see her otherwise. See what she says once the tables are turned.
6	why vitamin B12 and folic acid is essential for RBC production? Erythropoiesis is regulated by erythropoietin, which increases in the presence of hypoxia and regulates RBC production. In most species, the kidney is both the sensor organ and the major site of erythropoietin production, so chronic renal failure is associated with anemia. Erythropoietin acts on the marrow in concert with other humoral mediators to increase the number of stem cells entering RBC production, to shorten maturation time, and to cause early release of reticulocytes. Other factors that affect erythropoiesis are the supply of nutrients (eg, iron, folate, or vitamin B12) and cell-cell interactions between erythroid precursors, lymphoid cells, and other components of the hematopoietic microenvironment. Factors that may suppress erythropoiesis include chronic debilitating diseases and endocrine disorders (such as hypothyroidism or hyperestrogenism).

8	i'm trying to fix the problems with my gf? i have been dating my current gf for 3years and i really love her to death.the problem started about two months ago when i missed two very important days.The anniversary and her birthday which were all in one week of each other.I work the nightshift on the weekends and trying to get a day off is almost impossible.on top of that work got real busy and i could not get the chance to call her for one week. now she feels like we are not dating and that i don't love her which is wrong because I really do.I told her that iam sorry over and over again because i admitted that i messed up. We are supposed to have a long talk on saturday and she said it could go either way, which i really don't know what to say now. I asked her if she still loves me and i get "i don't know". but if i say "i love you" she says love you too, iam soo confused what to say or do.i just sent flowers and a sorry card to her work maybe she will see that iam really sorry. can you help me even though i messed up bad.jeff You messed up but its not worth ending a 3 year relationship over.  Buy her something nice, explain to her what happened and how you feel.  If she can't accept it she is just being difficult and its not worth the effort.
1	do you know where I can get information about the Earth's interior? The Earth's structure is the geologic and atmospheric structure of earth.\nContents\n[hide]\n\n    * 1 Shape\n    * 2 Structure\n    * 3 Interior\n          o 3.1 Interior heat\n          o 3.2 Structure\n    * 4 The core\n    * 5 Mantle\n    * 6 The Crust\n    * 7 Hydrosphere\n    * 8 Atmosphere\n    * 9 Historical development and alternative conceptions\n    * 10 See also\n\n[edit]\n\nShape\n\nThe Earth's shape is that of an oblate spheroid, with an average diameter of approximately 12,742 km. The rotation of the Earth causes the equator to bulge out slightly so that the equatorial diameter is 43 km larger than the pole to pole diameter. The largest local deviations in the rocky surface of the Earth are Mount Everest (8,850 m above local sea level) and the Mariana Trench (10,911 m below local sea level). Hence compared to a perfect ellipsoid, the Earth has a tolerance of about one part in about 584, or 0.17%. For perspective, this is a bit more than the 0.05% tolerance allowed in billiard balls. Due to the bulge, the feature farthest from the center of the Earth is actually Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5980 yottagrams (5.98 x 1024 kg).\n[edit]\n\nStructure\n\nThe interior of the Earth, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is chemically divided into layers. The Earth has an outer silicate solid crust, a highly viscous mantle, a liquid outer core that is much less viscous than the mantle, and a solid inner core. The liquid outer core gives rise to a weak magnetic field due to the convection of its electrically conductive material.\n\nNew material constantly finds its way to the surface through volcanoes and cracks in the ocean floors (see seafloor spreading). Many of the rocks now making up the Earth's crust formed less than 100 million (1×108) years ago; however the oldest known mineral grains are 4.4 billion (4.4×109) years old, indicating that the Earth has had a solid crust for at least that long [1].\n\nTaken as a whole, the Earth's composition by mass [2] is:\n\n    iron: 35 .1 %\n    oxygen: 28 .2 %\n    silicon: 17 .2 %\n    magnesium: 15 .9 %\n    nickel: 1 .6 %\n    calcium: 1 .6 %\n    aluminium: 1 .5 %\n    sulfur: 0 .70 %\n    sodium: 0 .25 %\n    titanium: 0 .071 %\n    potassium: 0 .019  %\n    other elements:     0 .53 %\n\nInterior heat\n\n    Main article: geothermal (geology)\n\nThe interior of the Earth reaches temperatures of 5650 ± 600 kelvins [3] [4]. The planet's internal heat was originally generated during its accretion (see gravitational binding energy), and since then additional heat has continued to be generated by the decay of radioactive elements such as uranium, thorium, and potassium. The heat flow from the interior to the surface is only 1/20,000 as great as the energy received from the Sun.\n[edit]\n\nStructure\n\nEarth's composition (by depth below surface):\n\n    * 0 to 60 km - Lithosphere (locally varies 5-200 km)\n          o 0 to 35 km - Crust (locally varies 5-70 km)\n          o 35 to 60 km - Uppermost part of mantle\n    * 35 to 2890 km - Mantle\n          o 100 to 700 km - Asthenosphere\n    * 2890 to 5100 km - Outer Core\n    * 5100 to 6378 km - Inner Core\n\n[edit]\n\nThe core\n\nThe average density of the Earth is 5515 kg/m3, making it the densest planet in the Solar system. Since the average density of surface material is only around 3000 kg/m3, we must conclude that denser materials exist within the core of the Earth. Further evidence for the high density core comes from the study of seismology. Since iron is the heaviest element that can be created by a star's fusion, the core of the earth and the other planets must be iron. All heavier elements are rare or trace. In its earliest stages, about 4.5 billion (4.5×109) years ago, melting would have caused denser substances to sink toward the center in a process called planetary differentiation, while less-dense materials would have migrated to the crust.
1	Rocket Science? Hydrazine, N2H4 , and its derivatives are widely used as rocket fuels. The combustion of hydrazine with oxygen produces N2 (g) and H2O (g). When 1.90 grams of hydrazine is burned in a bomb calorimeter, the temperature of the calorimeter rises by 4.20oC. The calorimeter contains 925.0 g of water, and the bomb has a heat capacity of 887.0 J/K. What is the heat of reaction in KJ/mol for the combustion of one mole of hydrazine? I searched through my thermodynamics book for this, so I hope you appreciate it.\nFirst, you need a ballanced chemical equation.\n\n2N2H2 + O2 ---> 2H2O + 2N2\n\nC = 887.0 J/K = 0.8870 kJ/ K\nn = 1 mol (since it's a 2 to 2 relation, we can just say 1)\ndelta T = T = 4.20 ºC = 4.20 K\nq = ?\n\nq = CT/n = (0.8870 kJ/K * 4.20 K) / (1 mol) \n  =  3.73 kJ/mol\n\n\nHope this helps!

9	Ok ,we gave amnesty to five million,do we give amnesty to twelve million?how many next time? Should we just rename America "New Mexico"? Lets face it the only people who are gaining from mass immigration are the minority rich, the majority working class will have to put up without wage increases for a long time. Notice how 50 years ago men only had to work and they could still pay all the bills for the whole family now even with 2 family members working, working class families struggle to pay their bills.
0	Does society in general have a problem with lesbians/gays or is it just a religious issue? What are yyour thoughts? Does it really bother you? Heidi Religion simply serves to validate homophobic feelings that will naturally arise, especially in men, in a patriarchal, macho society. In general, people find the sexually "deviant" acts of other people disgusting, although they have no problem with the ones they themselves engage in. For example, although both oral and anal sex would be considered deviant according to the Bible, most conservative Christian males only have a problem with the idea of anal sex because it implies male on male sex, which disgusts them personally because they're not attracted to men. But the idea of oral sex performed on a woman doesn't bother them. And in fact, some of them even engage in anal sex themselves, with women of course, but have no problem criticizing homosexuals who do the same. It's basically a double standard based on personal preferences and rationalized using religion as an excuse.\n\nAnother way you can tell it's a hypocritical double standard is to look closely at the verses in which the Bible appears to forbid sodomy and compare them to verses forbidding other things. For example, although sodomy appears to be forbidden only in the Old Testament, and is usually only mentioned in the context of another string of perversions as if sodomy alone were not the true problem, divorce and remarriage are forbidden not only in the Old Testament but in the New Testament as well. Jesus expressly forbids the separation of two people who have been brought together in marriage in God's name, but he says nothing whatsoever about homosexuality. Furthermore, if you look at the book in which the majority of the verses supposedly aimed against sodomy appear, Leviticus, you'll notice that it comes down equally as hard on a number of other behaviors which we have not vilified, including talking back to your parents. Therefore it's obvious that religious scripture is not the source of homophobia. The true source is a double standard born of personal preference and intolerance and rationalized by selective reading of religious scripture.

2	Do you find this an interesting phenomenon? I have noticed that in hot weather, especially during summer, I'm not as hungry and when I do eat I tend to eat lighter stuff like salad, bread, crackers and fruit. In cold, winter weather, on the other hand, I feel I need to eat warm, meaty dishes. The winter is the time of year I have to make an extra effort to keep my weight down. What are your thoughts on this? you eat heavier food because your body instinctively tells you that it's getting cold and you need more energy to produce heat

9	Wht is reason behind 9/11 and who is real culprit? I donot want simple 1-2 line ans. Every answer must have valid/reasobale reason. It's a good thing you don't want just a one or two line response; it's never quite that easy.\n\nFirst, it comes from a sense on the part of al-Qaeda that the U.S. is the "Great Satan."  What initially set these guys off was when the U.S. deployed to Saudi Arabia to fight Iraq in 1991.  The mudjaheddin believed they should be the ones fighting the Iraqis -forgetting that most of their weapons & support came from the U.S. anyway.  Being passed over in favor of the U.S. was a big irritant.\n\nSo, because of what amounts to a huge inferiority complex, they felt (and still feel) the need to hurt the U.S.  After the 1993 World Trade Center bombings, the disaster in Mogadishu, the 1998 embassy attacks in Africa, and the USS Cole attack, they figured the U.S. didn't have the guts to use force against them, beyond firing a couple of cruise missiles which may or may not have done anything serious besides blow up an aspirin factory in Sudan.\n\nThe Clinton administration didn't do anything to disabuse them of this notion; to their credit, mustering the kind of support needed would have been difficult in general, and impossible under his key supporters.  After several years of planning, 19 terrorists hijacked four airliners, and we all know the rest.\n\nPart of this was hoping that the U.S. would invade Afghanistan and then al-Qaeda could somehow cause the country's collapse.  Why did they think this?  Because, less than two years after the end of the Soviet occupation, the Soviet Union collapsed.  Any serious student of international relations knows, of course, that such thinking is, to say the least, deeply flawed, but that's what they thought.  Al-Qaeda also believed that we would deploy tanks & infantry and do what the Soviets did, assuming, of course, we would even have the will to fight, which he didn't believe we had.  So, what did happen came as a major surprise.\n\nHonestly, if anyone thinks that someone else caused 9/11, they're crazy.  Al-Qaeda did it after failing to blow it up in 1993.

Hi:\n\nthe truth table for binary addition is :\n\n0+0 =0 \n0+1 =1\n1+0 =1\n1+1 = 10 { the one is carried over to the next digit}\n\nfor example 7 + 3 = 10 decimal \n\n111 is 7 decimal in binary  because 4(1)+2(1) +1(1) = 4+2+1=7\n011 is 3 decimal in binay   because 4(0) +2(1) +1(1) = 2+1= 3 \n\nokay let add \n\n{ ignore the # symbol it for postioning thing here it add nothing to the problem okay.\n\n## 111\n#+ 011\n----------\n\n\nfrom our truth table of adding number 1+1 = 10 \nso :\n\n####1 - ( carry section here)\n## 111\n#+ 011\n----------\n#####0\n\nand 1+1= 10 however we have a carry of 1here so get added on \nso 1+1+1= 11 So we do the following:\n\n## 11 - ( carry section here)\n## 111\n#+ 011\n----------\n### 10\n\nNow we add the next column. Like so: 1+0= 1 but we have a carry of 1 so: 1+1= 10 and we do like so :\n\n# 111 -( carry section here) \n## 111\n#+ 011\n----------\n##010 \n\nNow in the next column we have a 1 in the carry section but nothing in that column so a zero is put here and added. So 1+0 = 1. And we do the following:\n\n\n#111 -( carry section here)\n+0111\n##011\n----------\n#1010 \n\nand 1010 is the answer because   8(1)+(0)4+(1)2+(0)1= 8+2 = 10 decimal \n\nSo 3 decimal which is 011 binary and 7 decimal in binary is 111 when add together is 10 decimal; which in binary is 1010 \n\nand that is how you add numbers in Binary\n\nMulitiply in is the same as multiplication of 1 and 0 \n\nfor example let do 5 times 5 in binary \n\n\nSo 5= 101 binary \n\n\n##101\n#x101\n----------\nStarting with the right column Multiply 101 by 1 which equals 101\n\nSo :\n\n\n##101\n#x101\n----------\n### 101\n\nnow with the next colum from the right multiply the 101 by 0 it equals 0 \n\nSo \n\n\n##101\n#x101\n----------\n### 101\n## 000\n\nnow for the final column multiply 101 by 1 and it equal 101 \n\nSo \n\n\n##101\n#x101\n----------\n### 101\n## 000\n# 101\n-------------\n\n\nAdd the partial additions here to get :\n\n##101\n#x101\n----------\n### 101\n## 000\n# 101\n-------------\n11001 \n\nLet see if this is the right answer \n\n16(1) +8(1) +4(0) +2(0)+1(1) = 16 + 8+1= 25\n\nSo 5 x 5 = 25 \nor 101(5 binary) time 101( 5 binary) = 11001(25 binary ) \nthis check out \n\n\nDivision is a bit more involved but lets do it:\n\n5 divided by 2 \n\nSo 5 =101 and 2= 10 \n\nsetup the problem like so:\n\n\n##___________________\n10/101.00000000000000\n\n\nSo let start by how many 10 will go into 10 the answer 1 \n\nSo \n\n##_1_________________\n10/101.00000000000000\n-10\n----------- \n### 1\n\nhow many 10 will go in to 1 answer 0 So \n\n##_10._________________\n10/101.00000000000000\n-10\n----------- \n####1\n### -0 \n------------\n####10 \n\nPut our decimal point here{ because we reached it } and \nHow many 10 will go into 10 answer 1 \n\nSo :\n\n##_10.1_________________\n10/101.00000000000000\n-10\n----------- \n####1\n### -0 \n------------\n####10 \n### -10\n--------------- \n######0 \n\nNo need to go any farther all the rest are zeros from here\n\nSo the answer is 10.1 binary which is \n\n2(1)+ 1(0) + (1)(1/2) = 2 1/2 decimal which is the correct answer \n\nuse this  to help you :\n\n\n\n\n 4096, 2048, 1024, 512 ,  256 , 128 ,  64 , 32 , 16 , 8, 4, 2  1\n##0####0####0###0####0####1###1###1###1# 1#1#0#1 \n\nput in the 1's and zero's in the 2 place holder like I got above here.\n\nmultiply the 1 and the zeros where they appear in the 2's place holder { I ignore the the leading zeros here} like so:\n\n 128(1)+64(1)+32(1)+ 16(1)+8(1) +4(1) +2(0)+1(1) \n\n128+64+32+16+8+4+1 =  253  \n\nso: 11111101 binary is 253 decimal \n\nthe best way to do this is to set your computer's calulator to Binary by clicking the bin circle enter your binary number and select the dec circle to tell you what the decimal number is \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n\n\nHope this helps
2	what could cause memory lost.urgent pls? i need to know how could someone loose his memory serioucely on perpose other wise am going to comitt suicide pls dn't tell me talk to someone to help for if i wanted i would have.just need to forget what i have gone through the whole 5years ago.or recomend a guaranteed and painless way to comitt suicide You seem to have gone through some very distraught things in the past 5 years. Please don't give up yet. Whatever horrible things you've gone through, from now on, start filling your life and memories with positive things. The way our memory works is, you remember best, things that are hooked to what you already know. Therefore, if you want to forget things, best way is to not think about those things, or have things that will trigger your memory of those things. However, it is probably very difficult to avoid everything that would remind you of what you have gone through. It is therefore, better for the long run, if you learn to accept the past (yes, including the horrible things that have happened to you), and be the strong person, and live on. Don't let the past conquer you. You conquer it. The future is in your hands. You can't change the past, but you can certainly change the future.
9	how the global warming and the air pollution would be controlled? Global warming and pollusion are the big threat to the human existance in the forthcoming future. What measure will have to be adopped to protect the earth? Apparently you haven't seen some of the dire warnings, it's too late to stop the greenhouse effect, we can slow it but it's already too far gone.  The Greenland ice melting is expected to raise ocean levels by 3 inches in the not too distant future....there's more, but i know the consequences to the climatic are pretty severe.

8	Ladies...I need ADVICE...MY Girlfriend...? She complains that I'm too big, you know....down THERE.  When I tell her to just shut up and take it, after I'm done with her she pouts for about a day or two.  She's really FAT so why can't she just be happy that she even has a man and do what I want? Your question isn't worth an answer.  If you brag about what you have, you probably don't!  Once a guy told me about the same and I told him, "well if its to big the meat clever in the kitchen drawer will take care of the problem".  Never saw him afterwords.

1	Are love bugs man-made? Popular tongue-in-cheek lore holds that love bugs are actually man-made, the result of a genetics experiment gone wrong. Since the creature had no natural enemies and seemed to spend its entire lifespan continually mating, its numbers quickly exploded into the trillions (or so it often seems).
9	What does it mean for the House now that the Democrats have gained control? honestly nothing. Govt wise since we have a republican president and a democratic house we will have a more balanced govt. but with that nothing gets done. As far as within the house, just that the dems have a few more votes to cancel whatever ideas/bills the republicans are pushing. Politicians are politicians doesnt' matter what party you belong to.
9	If people believe Islam is a violent religion, why don't they just read the Quran for themselves?  It's not! If you read the Quran, it says "To kill one person, it is as if you killed all of humanity.  If you saved one person, it is as if you saved all of humanity." I agree with you whole-heartedly.  The actions of terrorists in the name of Allah and Islam brings shame on good Muslims everywhere.  \n\nHowever, I do see one issue that people of faith need to address.  Very few Imams have publicly condemned the actions of terror groups and set the record straight on Islam.  This is a serious error on their part.  By their silence, they appear to give endorsement to these actions.  Even American Imams have failed to do this on a large scale.  Why this is, I cannot say as I am neither Imam nor Muslim.  \n\nI can say that good people of faith -- all faiths -- need to speak out loudly and clearly in condemnation of terror in the name of any religion.  Anything less deprecates the faith and gives aid and comfort to those who have neither love nor faith in their hearts.
9	As an individual in the USA, forwarding funds for foreign companies, do I have to file any paper work? My friend's company is based out of the USA. And they use Paypal as one of their means of collecting funds. Paypal does not support Bank Transfer to their country.\n\nWhat my friend's company does is, they transfer a certain amount of money from their Paypal account to my Paypal account everyday. I withdraw the Paypal funds into my Bank Account, then cash the money. I then forward the cash via Western Union to my friend's Bank Account in the foreign country.\n\nI am not profiting a cent from this. I am just doing him a favor. My friend's company is legitimate, and the money is clean. And he is not subjected to any tax in the USA.\n\nDo I have to file any paper work? As I know that this might trigger off an alarm with the banking and money system. Depends on the amount of money, and possibly where it's going. In general, though, it's getting tougher to send money overseas. There might be issues related to the Patriot Act, for example.\n\nI'd suggest doing a web search for the particular country that you're trying to send to.

2	best way to stop craving? Just eat whatever youre craving!  Make sure youre doing it in a healthy way though.  For example, if you crave a milkshake, try making one with skim milk, crushed ice, protein powder (whatever flavor milkshake youre craving) and a big dollop of cool whip (stick it in the blender).  If it's pizza, make a homemade one with only fresh veggies and/or lean meats with part skim or fat free cheese.  And everything in moderation.  Put exactly one serving on your plate and put the rest away.  Laziness usually wins out, so you probably wont go get more, even if youre still hungry, esp if reheating is involved.  What do you crave?  I can try to give you a healthier alternative if you would like.
2	what are scabies? i have a friend who just called and saud she has them...should i let her over my house? OK, this is kind of gross.  Scabies are actually tiny insects that burrow under the skin and cause redness, rash, etc.  It's easily treatable, though, so don't cut your friend off! You may want to see your doctor if you start itching, though.

6	Copyright / patent ideas? How does one copyright or patent an idea to protect yourself from someone stealing it? *Noddling for I've had to look into this more than once* KK as far as current standards for things like music, images, ect, basically if you can prove you have the files, recordings, ect to create it, it is yours.\n\nNow for the laws on registration, http://www.copyright.gov/\nMany artists, writers, and musicians mistakenly believe that the creator of a work automatically owns the copyright. That's not always the case. Exceptions to the rule occur when a work is created by an employee in the course of his or her employment, or if the work is created by an independent contractor and qualifies as a work "made for hire," or if the creator has sold or transferred all rights attached to the copyright.\n\nYahoo has an area that talks about the topic here http://sbs.smallbusiness.yahoo.com/resources/subCat.php?mcid=4&scid=26\n\nNow pretty much everwhere you go, even straight to the patent office they want a fee, the trick is to find the lowest available fee if you go that route.\n\nNote though, the courts have changed since "Poor Man's Copyright" was created, the practice of mailing yourself a sealed registered letter containing the originals is not accepted in the USA...

6	is there a best time to close on a house? Beg, middle or end of month? is there a cost savings? Is there delayed payment? \nPlease give details in your answer! \nthanks 2 words...prepaid interest. it is best to close your loan at the end of the month. you will pay less interest and you will still get a month or so off from your next mortgage payment. If your original loan payment is around the first of the month try to close your loan by the 25th or so that way you wont have to pay your next month's payment, and by the time the new lender mails you a statement, it wont be scheduled to pay until the next month.
6	what would u do if u found a $1000 on a street? look for owner?\nkeep it?\nspend it on what? urslef? someone homeless? Truthfully, I'd hold onto it. I would then read the papers in the lost and found section every day for a week or two. If someone was looking for it, I'd contact them. IF they could tell me how much was missing and in what denominations Like four hundred in twenties, and the rest in fifties and hundreds. And this is what I found then I'd most likely return it. If no one ran an ad for it after like a month or so, I think I'd claim it as mine.

5	Why are the Majority of Spurs fans complete idiots? *rises to the bait, as a Spurs fan* ;-)\n\nSeeing as the club probably has 30,000 regular visitors to White Hart Lane, each week, and many many more supporters (it's supposed to be in the top 5 of supported clubs in the English Premier League), then you make a bold claim. Do you claim to say that you've met a majority of these people, and can verify that each is an idiot? That would imply that at the very minimum you have met 15,000 Spurs fans, and have been struck by their idiocy.\n\nI think the asker has pre-existing bias against Spurs, and should be examined for the Arsenal-virus in his blood, and held in quarantine till he responds to treatment ;-)
4	how does google search engine work ?

She would get really pissed off whenever I opened the door for her.

The  next morning, Ed got up early and left for work. When his wife woke up, she looked out the  window and sure enough, there was a small box gift wrapped in the middle of the   driveway.Confused, the wife put on her robe and ran out to the driveway and brought the box back in the  house. She opened it and found a brand new bathroom scale. \n\nFuneral services for Ed have been  scheduled for Friday.xxx

1	What does deontological mean? In ethics, deontological ethics or deontology (Greek: Deon meaning obligation or duty) is a theory holding that decisions should be made solely or primarily by considering one's duties and the rights of others. Deontology posits the existence of a priori moral obligations, further suggesting that people ought to live by a set of defined principles that do not change merely as a result of a change in circumstances (ie. situational ethics).\n\nOne of the most important implications of deontology is that praiseworthy goals can never justify immoral actions, in contrast to doctrines that claim the ends justify the means. Deontology is directly in opposition to consequentialism, an ethical theory in which the ends can justify the means because decisions are judged primarily in terms of their consequences.

9	Can we ban democrats and republicans from presidential election 2008? I'm sick of both these political parties. It's time they were banned from an election so we can get a real president who cares about the USA. Ha!!! You and me both, I remember it say somewhere about "A government for the people and by the people" I think it has become "A government for itself and forget the people" Now I do understand you can not please everyone, but, man they seem to be getting more controlling all the time. More and More tax paid agencies to harass people with Tax payer resources. There are many other Political Parties, some can only run in one state stuff like that and then there the Independent party of which I do believe that One President was Elected. Funny how when they have a Presidential Debate the only Parties there are the Republican and Democrat. I know people not think much of that short guy, I think Ross Perot something like that. Everyone was too busy Hooting and Hollering he not a good choice they MISSED an important point. HE WAS NOT allowed to Debate. WHY? Whether he was good for the job or not, it seems to me the Presidential Debate should be just that and Include ALL those applying for the position. Guess I wrong though. :-p

Just like the Irish guy who starts to chat to a blonde in a bar. "Can I buy you a drink?" He asks.\n\n"No thanks I'm  a lesbian." She replies.\n\n"Oh and which part of Lesby are you from?" He asks\n\n"No, you don't understand. You see that brunette down the other end of the bar? Well I'd like to take her to bed and make mad passionate love to her all night." She explains.\n\n"Hellfire." He replies. "What a co-incidence. I must be  a lesbian too!"

3	can cast iron be reprocessed into wrought iron, if so would it be economical? Of course! In fact, in the steel industry, cast iron is made into wrought iron. Several processes r useful; I personally know of the Puddling process. There cast iron is melted when impurities escape in the form of their oxides, & then it solidifies as wrought iron . This is then employed to prepare steel by the Bessemer process.

2	can someone have tb and get over it on their own without treatment? I have a coworker who has had a awful cough and has been coughing up blood and occassionaly complains of chest pains. It has recently dawned on me that those are symptoms of tb. Myself as well as some of my coworkers had what we thought was the most horible cold we ever experienced that lasted about 3 weeks. For the most part we all feel better, but is it possible we contracted tb and our immune system fought it and now it is dormant in our system? tuberculosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of infective origin. it can be diagnosed with the help of a chest x ray and sputum culture. it is treatable within 6-9 months of regular medicines which are usually available free in india in all primary health centers run by central/state governments. and NO, the body cannot fight this infection on its own and YES, medicines are a must.

5	How do you teach kids to run faster, run properly? Kids have great visual imaginations, so make use of it with this drill: imagine there's a coathanger in your back and your arms are being hoisted up by a puppeteer. Run a short 200 metre course imagining you're still suspended on a rail, keeping a straight line right down your form from head to toe. Practice like this until it feels natural, always keeping upright and erect. Keep arms at your hips and don't pump too hard. Accelerate by pushing forward fro the knees down. It's how professional athletes are trained at first. Balance, posture, control are core elements of any training to articulate to kids. Enjoy!

0	Why do people pierce their ears with those piercing that stretch the skin? I mean what is the point? What are they going to do 10,15,30yrs from now when it's not cool and out of fashion? I have stretched earlobes.  More than ten years ago, when it was far from being "in fashion", countless people told me that I'd regret it.  Well, a hell of a lot of time has passed and I love my ears more than I did when I started.\n\nAs for you wanting to know what the "point" is, for myself it has been purely ornamental.  Honestly, I would not look or feel like myself if I looked any way other than the way that I do.\n\nYour question has an antagonistic element to it, as in maybe you think poorly about people who choose to do this.  Try to be less judgmental.  There may be things about you that others would look at and question in a similar manner.

2	What to do about a sore coochie? I has some rough sex last night and it went on for 2 hours its was good but my cochie is sore any remedies?? He F@#Ked the Sh*t outta me and im all smiles but the my stuff is sore. Help This is going to sound weird, but it absolutely works: Put some ice cubes in there, and don't piddle around about it (make it quick).  It will shock your muscles into tightening up, which is what the problem is.  During sex the striations of your muscle walls in there are are spread apart and loosened up (especially after a climax), and that entire area becomes more vulnerable to friction issues,  which is what's causing the agitation you're experiencing.  Simply shock those striations and the skin over them into tightening up, and you should instantly feel a lot better.

1	what is the physical aspect of differential equations? GRAPHICAL ASPECT AND PHYSICAL MEANING. Charecteristics of physical systems is defined by differential equation. For example  a second order linear differential equation can define an RLC circuit. An antennae and it's polar diagram can be defined by a Legendre differential equation from which the whole antennae can be described and designed. A Bessel differential equation can define movement of planets in space. This can also be used to define cetain type of Electrical cirucuits. Butterworth, Chebyshev etc; polynomials define certain other type of Electrical circuits. So basically these are mathematical models of physical systems.

When I picked her up, she looked like an angel, We went to The cheesecake factory, had a great conversation over dinner, and we talked for almost 3 hours at the resturant, after we went to the lake and rented a boat and I rowed her around while we talked what seemed forever, after which we went to the improv comedy club and laughed over the comics.  After we went to a local irish pub, had a few drinks while we watched a irish folk singer, then I dropped her off at her house after spending all day together.  She told me that it was the best date she has ever had, because although we spend alot of time together in one day, it seemed like a minute, because of all the fun and the great converstion together.
0	how do i get my crazy parents to stay out of my life and leave me alone? Well, you didnt give much info on your life and I will assume you live at home.  If you do still live at home, you will pretty much have to suck it up until you move out on your own.\n\nAfter about 6 months of "freedom" which means for most new renters/leasers that you are probably about one pay check from being in the streets or mooching off friends, you will probably understand why they were trying to keep you straight with some rules while you were at home.\n\nBasically, they are trying to see you live to be old enough to move out on your own and develop enough responsibility to maintain yourself without becoming a homeless bum when you finally do.

8	How does one explain love in words? I was asked a question the other day that got me thinking. A guy friend of mine asked me how do you know you truly love someone. I gave him the reasons I thought were right to me and he said I was wrong. \n\nSo I am interested in hearing from other individuals, how do you know you are truly in love and what constitutes love? Now there is a difference between infatuation and love. I think we all know this.\n\nIt sounds like a dumb question but I felt as if I got a dumb response to his question for me. Well, there have been many times when I thought I was in love. I realize now that those times were more about infatuation or courtship that was all about what we could get from each other. \n\nI'm with someone now who I feel completely different about. We communicate well, which I think is key in a successful relationship. We are able to talk about difficult subjects without embarrasment or hard feelings. We have many things in common, but also have separate interests. We are very honest with each other and don't keep things from each other that might be im[portant to the other person. \n\nAll these things are important if a relationship is going to last, but you can have a relationship that has all these things without being in love. \n\nI think I am in love now. My siginifigant other makes me feel important, but also makes me feel like I'm able to care for him and be cared for. We are considerate of each other without having to ask. We are able to read each other very well, and are friends before we are lovers. Being lovers is really just a perk. A very good perk. \n\nThe most important thing, I think, of how to tell you are in love is if you really care abouit the person's well-being- if you do things and help them achieve their goals with no thought to how it will benefit yourself and if they do the same for you.

8	Are women as horny as men? As a woman, how do you feel males and females are different in this way? As a woman, I know the answer is generally yes. The difference is that women use more self control than men do. We also tend to prefer an emotional commitment first, whereas most men don't find that necessary. I truly believe it's biological, however. A man can reproduce until he dies, but a woman's reproductive years come to an end (menopause). I understand this to mean that perhaps people were not biologically intended to mate for life, as we assume. Marriage is actually a manmade concept enforced by religions (also manmade). So it would make sense for a man to have a roving eye, although that doesn't necessarily make it acceptable in today's society.

3	Does anyone have any advice for studying for final exams? These are college final exams. Prepare adequately (study) for at least a week or more and don't stay up late each nite. Get plenty of rest on the day of the exam. Then on exam day, DO NOT EAT anything 1 hour before the exam. Eat something (high protein and non-greasy food only) 2 to 3 hours before the exam. Then right before the exam, drink soda pop (Mountain Dew or JOLT is preferred). This last advise is crucial. If you can't find any colas like Coke or Pepsi, drink honey mixed in water. You need the sugar, bottom line, specifically your brain. If you eat before the exam, your brain would be too busy to help you concentrate so eating before the exam is a no-no.

2	Is lupus hereditary? Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the immune system turns against the body and harms healthy cells and tissues. Lupus, which is also considered a rheumatic (arthritic) disease, can affect many parts of the body including the joints, skin, kidneys, lungs, heart or brain. Some of the most common symptoms include extreme fatigue, painful or swollen joints, unexplained fever, skin rashes, and kidney problems.\n\nWe don’t know yet what causes the immune system to become overactive. Scientific evidence indicates that lupus is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Studies show that lupus runs in families, meaning that certain genes predispose you to the disease. Environmental triggers may include ultraviolet light, bacterial and viral infections, medications, diet and stress. \n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, nine out of ten people who have lupus are women. It often first appears during the childbearing years—ages 15 to 45. Lupus is three times more common in African American women than in Caucasian women, and is also more common in women of Hispanic, Asian, and Native American descent. \n\nLupus is not contagious. You cannot give it to someone else.\n\nThere currently is not a cure for lupus and treatments may have serious side effects. The Alliance for Lupus Research hopes that more intensive research will lead to better treatments and a cure. In the meantime, people with lupus should seek the care of a physician familiar with the disease.
8	some people say sex toys help, some dont. who's rite? for him, or for her is it better? They're great when you don't have any other outlet. They're also great when you have someone, but can't get with them.\n\nAnd, of course, they're ROCK when you share them with your partner. As long as they remain a diversion and not the sole focus of your activity, sex toys are great when shared.

2	How Do I..............................? My stomach is freakin skinny, but I need help on how to loose weight from my thighs and butt. Please help. What kind of exercise should I do??? Sorry to say this, but there's no such thing as spot reduction.  Different people carry and lose weight in different areas then others.  You're actually very lucky.  People that store more fat in areas away from the chest and midsection are much less likely to have heart and other weight related problems.  I'd just perform exercises and cardio that focus on the legs and butt to help tone those areas, and make sure to eat healthy.
8	I got a girls number at the bar last night how long should I wait before I call her.? You always here 3 days.  When do girls really expect a guy whom they gave their number to, to call them. If you got it last night (Thursday), call her late morning Saturday.  3 days is too long.  Calling right away says "desperate."  Be casual, but respectful.  Girls who say "call right away" don't really mean that - when they get those calls they think there's something wrong with you - you're either desperate or aren't confident.

I wonder why people would not have this when their is such an affordable plan that can save people tons of money??? I have health insurance, but it costs me 50 bucks a week. Where as my boyfriend does not. He can't afford it at the job we are at, but the state says he makes to much to get free health. And to get partical, you have to pay a $1700 dectable...his bills aren't even that much. So i guess you have to be completely poor to get any health help. We had to take him to the ER and now he owes $1200. Health in this country is so unbelievable. I can't believe that they will give an immagrant free health and not help out a citizen that has been here all his life working his ass off. Friggen messed up. You can go to any other country and the health is sooo much cheaper..gah...sorry, I could go on all night :P
1	ifall the  galaxies are getting  named....do they  know what their name  s  are......seeB? ....B....what  is the  name  of  our  solar  system...seeC\n....C....what  would  you  name  our  solar  system? It would be hopeless to try to name every single one of the galaxies. There are about 50 billion of them. Instead scientist give them a catalogue name like NGC 1566 (New General Catalogue no. 1566 aka the Seyfert galaxy). Some galaxies were thought to have been nebulae or the remnants of stars. Charles Messier came up with a catalogue to organize them. Some, like M87, were not nebulae but galaxies and globular clusters. M87 is a gigantic elliptical galaxy that has a supermassive black hole, some 3 billion times more massive than the sun, in it´s center. So before M87 was discovered to be a galaxy it actually had a name. The romantic name M87.\n\nOur solarsystem is simply called "Sol" after our parent star.
2	when in a situation that leads one to depriciate in the felt value of life how do you adapt it for the better? This one is really gonna depend on the person and the circumstances. Life will always have it's ups and downs, but a thing to really be aware of and look out for is depression. \n\nYou can tend to look toward how much worse off some others are than you and your circumstances to give you a better perspective on things. \n\nOn the other hand if you tend to compare your life now to how much better it was prior to this, then you may be setting yourself up to not be happy even when things turn around (as they will usually).\n\nLook at the things that are going well, build on them and do what you can to change the things that aren't so wonderful.\n\nSince I don't know the specifics, perhaps you could find others with the same problem or difficulties to talk with about this?\n\nGood luck and my best wishes for you.
0	Was Judas a traitor? I read in the newspaper that they found Judas' Gospel. They decided it was real, written around the year 300, but the story is of before that. According to it, Judas was the only real apostel and he was told by Jesus to sacrifise Jesus so he could shed his body (don't know the literla words). And that it was his duty to become the apostel know as a traitor even though he wasn't. What do you think? It changes everything doesn't it? \np.s. Don't shoot the messenger.... ANSA) - Rome, April 3 - A fourth-century papyrus manuscript containing the long-lost 'Gospel of Judas' will be presented in Washington on Thursday .\n\nThe Gospel of Judas is one of several ancient accounts of Christ's life which were rejected as suspect by the fathers of the early Church and so they did not become part of the Bible .\n\nVatican officials have denied that the publication this week is part of a rehabilitation of Judas by the Catholic Church .\n\nThe document reportedly argues that Judas Iscariot, known to Christians as the man who betrayed Jesus Christ, was an essential part of God's design and, as such, almost a hero .\n\nWithout his betrayal, Jesus would not have been crucified and so, the argument goes, God's plan to save mankind from its sins would not have been fulfilled .\n\nThe papyrus containing the text of the 'gospel' appeared about 30 years ago on the Egyptian antiquities market. It had last been heard of in AD180, when Saint Irenaeus, a bishop, condemned it as heretical .\n\nIt was recently acquired by the Swiss-based Maecenas Foundation for Ancient Art and the U.S.-based National Geographic magazine, who are behind this week's publication .\n\nThe text, which has been translated into English, French and German, is written in Coptic, the language used in Egypt when the country converted to Christianity halfway through the third century AD .\n\nThe text was the work of an ancient Gnostic sect called the Cainites, which made a habit of giving a positive value to all the negative figures in Christian scriptures .\n\nIt is believed to have been originally written in the first or second centuries. The text was later copied onto the papyrus which is to be presented in Washington .\n\nThe forthcoming publication has sparked fears among some in the Catholic Church that it could give people wrong ideas about the man who is famous for betraying Jesus Christ .\n\n"Some people will try to hide the truth and give undue importance to a document written in the 2nd century by people in open opposition to the early Christian Church," said a Rome-based theologian who is an expert on ancient texts .\n\nExperts say the manuscript is interesting and important for scholars of Church history but changes nothing in the accepted view of Judas .\n\nItaly's top Catholic writer, Vittorio Messori, noted however that the text does raise interesting questions about the role of Judas in the Christ story .\n\nInterviewed by the Turin daily La Stampa, he noted that a key difference between the Gospel of Judas and the Bible accounts concerns the question of forgiveness .\n\nMessori recalled that in the apocryphal account Judas is forgiven: "He weeps, Jesus forgives him and in order to purify him he sends Judas into the desert to do spiritual exercises." In the New Testament, in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is quoted as saying: "Woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born." After the betrayal, they never meet again and, overcome with remorse, Judas commits suicide. Christ atones for the sins of humanity but never specifically forgives Judas .\n\nMessori said the lack of forgiveness in the Bible account appeared strange in a man who preached forgiveness .\n\nHe also noted that Jesus's choice of Judas as a disciple in the first place seemed to show a slip of judgment .\n\nBut, as someone who wanted to believe the Gospels were true, he said he was glad of Judas's presence. "If the gospels had been invented, the figure of Judas just wouldn't be there because he's so embarrassing," he said .

It isn't just the western country economies dependent on it. One of the reason for gas price spikes have been a large increase in dependency from the biggest population countries, China and India. The problem is the entire world is dependent on a very limited supply of product.\nThe Western countries will never be come independent on their own supplies because they don't have enough supply to meet the demand. The only way that will change is if a new fuel supply comes along that is much cheaper and equal to or more efficient than fossil fuels, and it still requires us getting rid of the nearly 1 billion cars in the US currently.

If they were chronically sick or debilitated and/or took no joy out of living...perhaps it is their time to go. \n\nThere are very young old people and very old young people in the world.

5	how to build a suppresor? Supressors or silencers, are LEGAL in many areas of the US today (arizona, being one).\nConstruction can be rather simple.  The lengthy answer posted above describes what one is, but does little to help you build one.\ndepending on the power of your cartridge, you should attempt to have an outer tube of roughly 3 times the outer diameter of the barrell of the gun.\nwashers drilled to .05 inch larger than the bullet  (THIS must be precisely centered) welded to either end.  Internally you may use several methods\n1. the close stacked method.  This uses a series of hard and soft spacers, typically made of steel washers and 3M green scrubbing pad-type material (the kind used for scouring pots and pads) packed alternating materials until the tube is full.\na nut is centered and welded onto one of the end washers.\nThis is a heavy and not completely silent supressor, but it is cheap and easy to build\nthe second type follows current auto and motorcycle muffler design.\nagain starting with an outer tube and end washers correctly drilled.\ninside there is a steel screen or perforated sheet of steel rolled in a diameter slightly larger than the bullet, so as not to contact the bullet.  the space between the screen and the outer tube is stuffed with either fiberglass or steel wool.  If using steel wool, it is recommended to use various grades to help absorb a wider range of frequencies.\nThis type of supressor is musch lighter and efficient and lasts a VERY long time.  the drawback is that it takes a much more skilled hand to fabricate.\n\nENJOY!

We believe that romance is at the heart of happiness.\n\nWe fail to realize that the most succesful relationships are based on companionship.

7	Is it necessary to learn acoustic guitar for playing electric guitar?? I am interested in learning how to play electric guitar but dont know anything about guitars. Any information which will help me in learning the guitar is welcome. I am a 16 yr old boy. Good for you dude, I started playing when I was 15..I'm 34 now and can play like nobodies business. An electric guitar is the way to go when starting out. The string guage is much lighter, which makes it allot easier to fret. After you learn some stuff, it is good to play acoustic because it will build finger strength (much more pressure needed to play acoustic), which in turn will make you a stronger electric player.

No, it could be worse.. yes the skin has carbs because it has flour in it.. but not as many carbs as a piece of bread.. so your OK.. The coleslaw I looked up and had 22 grams.. which is pretty equivalent to a piece of bread. But\ndon't get upset, or feel like a failure, because that will only lead you to get off your diet.. some people have off days, and eat something they shouldn't when on a diet.. but don't let it discourage you..If you feel real guilty the best thing you can do after eating carbs is go for a walk and burn some of it off..  \nThe best way to lose weight though, is to find a diet that you can live with for the rest of your life, and usually that isn't a low carb diet.. maybe cut down your calories to 1000-1200 a day, and make Sunday a cheat day, where you can eat anything you want.. remember, sometimes its not the food you eat, but the portions you take.. \nGood Luck..

2	blood transfusions-how long does it take to notice a change in how you are feeling? I have had 1 after an episode where I lost a large amount of blood...it only took me about 3 days to feel normal again.  My mother had cancer and received 2, and she felt better within 24 hours.  It depends on the reason you are having one. She was going through chemo and became anemic.  She was very weak and dizzy, kept trying to pass out and could barely stand on her own feet, let alone walk.

Imagen a small solar system (Jupiter a sun with its own small planets) crossing our path and captured by our suns gravitational pull.and is drained our burns out quickly. Jupiter, while larger than all the other planets in our system put together, is still far too small to have ever been a star in its own rights. Furthermore, stars don't just "burn out". Depending on thier mass, they can undergo a number of different evolutions; many will go super-nova, spewing out unimaginable ammounts of heavy atoms and radiation, others will diminish into brown or whites "dwaves", still others will form black holes. \n\nIt might be possible (though incredibly unlikely) for a solar system to "ensnare" passing planetoids, but they would be unlikely to form stable orbits in the time that our solar system has been around.\n\nIt's an interesting idea, and although jupiter could never have been a star, it is proponderously unlikely, but not impossible, that it could have originated outside of our solar system.

9	Is California the only state where passing on the right is illegal? Passing on the right in California IS legal ...\n\n21755.   The driver of a motor vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle upon the right only under conditions permitting such movement in safety. In no event shall such movement be made by driving off the paved or main-traveled portion of the roadway.\n\nThank you Kovneva. It absolutely amazes me that people will actually answer this question incorrectly with the vehicle code cited right in front of them. I really appreciate your support.
4	what is the difference between 1.1 ghz and 60 g as far as speed? Hard disk - This is large-capacity permanent storage used to hold information such as programs and documents.\n\nCentral processing unit (CPU) - The microprocessor "brain" of the computer system is called the central processing unit. Everything that a computer does is overseen by the CPU.\n\n1.1ghz still will not tell you the full extent of the power behind the computer.  Things like celeron, pentium, pentium 4, pentium M, all help understand how powerful a computer is.\n\n60 gb is easy to  put in simple terms.  \n1 gb = 1024 mb\n1 CD = 700 mb\n1 DVD = 8.5 gb\n\nso that 60 gb can hold \n7 dvds\nor \n87 CDs\nor \n42,666 floppy disks

8	boyfriend tells a girl who's interested in him your business even bad talk you and says its not true when ask I have but one question for you.  Do you really need a friend like that, boy or girl?  If lies are there now they will always be there.  When your friends display qualities that aren't appropriate or honest it is often best to distance yourself from them then before they have a chance to be more serious.  People that lie are evil and often times that is not the only bad quality they have in their personalitiesl.
3	explain "coronary steal"? it's a cardiovascular condition...also known as "robin hood efect"..can you explain this to me? A "steal" or "steal syndrome" occurs when, as a result of dilation of the blood vessels or a "short-circuit" (fistula) between two blood vessels, blood is directed toward already well-oxygenated tissue and away from already oxygen-stressed tissue.\n\nWhen this occurs in the heart, it's called "coronary steal."  In that case, typically there is a blocked coronary artery; a vasodilator is administered and, as a result, oxygen is shunted away from the already oxygen-starved (ischemic) tissue.\n\nHowever, there can also be subclavian steal, cerebral steal, etc.\n\nA steal is sometimes called "Robin Hood syndrome," but this should properly be used only to describe an "inverse steal," in which the blood vessels constrict, thus robbing from the (oxygen) rich and giving to the (oxygen) poor.
1	How do X-ray machines work? An X-ray machine is essentially a camera. Instead of visible light, however, it uses X-rays to expose the film. \nX-rays are like light in that they are electromagnetic waves, but they are more energetic so they can penetrate many materials to varying degrees. When the X-rays hit the film, they expose it just as light would. Since bone, fat, muscle, tumors and other masses all absorb X-rays at different levels, the image on the film lets you see different (distinct) structures inside the body because of the different levels of exposure on the film. \n\nIf you want to know how X-rays themselves work try the site below.

6	What do you think is happening to the world today? I think that the world is not going to survive if we don't begin to call on the name of Jesus and depend on him for everything. Depend on him?  Don't you want to do things for yourself and for others as opposed to closing your eyes and hoping Jesus swoops down to fix things?  I think you should make the difference if you beleive that the world needs to change.  If you want you can even do it on behalf of your church but by no means do I think we should depend on Jesus to do everything.

I am new, about 2 months in this company.\n\nI am going out to meet some clients this week and my superior, one of the directors, had asked me to get their name and company stamp on one of the forms as a proof that I have visited them.\n\nThis is a normal procedure for lower ranking sales in the industry but as a part of the senior management I feel that there should be more trust. It's not like I am going home to sleep during those hours..\n\nWhat should I do? HR Managers reading this, perhaps you guys can advise. What is really visible and clear now that all companies left the flag of NO TRUST,\nthis is what i can feel rightnow,\nThis happens all the time with all people, honest and nonhonest,\nbut there's a trend now in management that smart manager who can put his subordinates under full control, making them feel like they are all thievs all the time,\nso that, nobody even think of making something wrong,\n\nbut for you,\nget him what he wants to prove you went there,\nand then, tell him you're dealing with a senior manager, not a junior fresh graduate !!!!\nIt's not a normal procedure to act like this with me

9	What year were better labor laws made for coal minors? As the coal industry grew, mining methods and laws changed rapidly.\nAs early as the 1850s, immigrants from Wales, England, and Scotland were brought over to work in the coal mines. As the coal industry grew, most of the mining was supported by out-of-state capital and thus was run by out-of-state in the mine superintendents. These men brought in cheap foreign labor, especially from southern Europe, and often abused them with long working hours, poor medical care, and generally inferior living conditions. The poor conditions in the mines brought about the first West Virginia coal mining legislation in 1883.\n\nA state mine inspector was appointed to inspect all mines for adequate safety conditions. In 1890, the state union of United Mine Workers of America was organized in Wheeling to push for better conditions. In 1905, the West Virginia Department of Mines was established to enforce inspections laws. But it was not until the Franklin Roosevelt era that the federal government stepped in to help the miners. The National Industrial Recovery Act, passed to help industry and labor during the Depression, established an 8-hour day and minimum wage provision, and condoned unions. Although the act was later declared unconstitutional, most of the industries had unionized by then. Since the 1930s, the union has been a powerful force in procuring welfare, retirement, and many other benefits for the miners.
0	Question about the Christian faith...? Not to sound anti-Christian or anything like that, but it is my belief, through reading about and listening to Christians and their Bible(s), that in reality, you are still Jewish.  The only reason you left the term "Jewish-Christian" was because the deciples got angry when the leaders of the regular Jewish sects denounced the Jewish-Christian followers for believing that Christ was the messiah.  You know what, I'm jewish, and i think it could be possible for Jesus to be the Messiah.  Not the actual human that lived 2000 years ago, but the sense that anyone can be the messiah.\n\nAlso,\n\nIf any of you were woundering.  Jesus cant be the jewish messiah.  There are rules for being the Jewish messiah, and Jesus does not fulfil enough, i believe he has 2 out of the 300+. http://biblia.com/jesusbible/prophecies.htm

3	Essay Structure Help!? I'm writing an essay entitled: 'Trade offs between Economy, Environment and Society'. (Based on Sustainable Development). I've got the introduction and conclusion sorted, but I'm struggling to get the middle part structured. I've got plenty of information (I'm using the Solomon Islands as a case study), but just no clue how to structure the middle/main discussion section. - Help! Outline, outline, outline. If you're in the middle of the paper and don't know where you're going, you'll need better planning for the paper overall.\n\nChoose a thesis and supporting points.\n\nEach supporting point is probably best handled separately.  Treat each supporting point as a "mini-essay", where you state your proposition and support with facts.\n\nSeriously, take a step back and plan before you go further. It'll make a big difference.

8	please help i need advice? i am planning to kiss the guy i like, he like me too but he is shy.\nwat u think?\nif u have tell me how it turn out to be.\nplease help\n\n\n\nthis question is for adult only This happened with me and my bf when we had just started dating. We've known eachother over a year now, but apparently he had liked me for months and I didn't know it, and he had finally built up the courage to ask me out (we've only been a couple for 7 months). On one particular day, we were together at a friends house alone watching a movie, and for the past few days leading up to that day, there were several moments where I knew he wanted to kiss me (like your guy), but he was nervous as to how I would react. I knew he would have a hard time kissing me first, so I decided I'd break the ice for him. Do you know those moments where something happens where you get so close to his face and it's the perfect opportunity to kiss, but you just don't? Well that had happened several times in those few days, and once that day already, but he still didn't kiss me. Well, he was massaging my legs, and we had another one of those moments, so I just leaned over, gently grabbed his face, and kissed him.  I could tell; he was so happy about it. After that, it gave him the confidence to kiss me whenever he wanted to, and how... well... let's just say we've come a long way~ *wink*\n\nJust one word of advice: if you want to break the ice, do it in privacy. After the initial kiss, and a few more private sessions,  public display of affection will come much easier.

9	does anyone know if you are in the Navy if you can transfer the rest of your active duty to the reserves? I know the airforce allows you to do this if you have less than 2 years of active duty left. Yes and No.\n\nThe US Navy requires a six year commitment for all enlistments.  Most enlistments are for 4 years of active duty which would require two years of reserve duty.  The amount of active duty time depends on your choice of schooling and enlistment contract.  If your contract requires 4 years of active duty, you must remain on active duty for four years.

6	Is it smarter to save money to pay off debt or start an IRA at 28 YRs. old? I am 28 and have about 33K in debt and don't make too much money, about 50K and have a mortgage.  I know an IRA is a smart move, though what about that pesky debt with high interest? What kind of debt are you talking about?  If you're talking about high interest credit card debt, then pay it off first.  If you're talking about a mortgage, a car loan, maybe a low interest school loan, then I would tell you to invest some monies.  I always advise my clients not to pay off their mortgage early.  It's nice having the tax deduction of the interest, and if you take a long time to pay off the mortgage, you're paying it off with money that has been eroded by inflation.   \nIf your company offers a 401k, go into that before an IRA.  Also, if your company offers you a retirement plan, you would only be able to do a Roth IRA and are limited to what you can invest.\nConsult a financial profession to evaluate your individual situation and help you make the right choice.

6	Where can I get my paystub information from adecco without having to pay for it? I tried to get the information through adecco themselves but they gave a paper saying they only deal with third party information wanters and they would have to pay a fee to access my info. So can someone please tell how I myself can access my own info for free? Adecco should be providing you with a stub for what THEY pay you.  Usually they are mailed to you at home or at work.  Adecco invoices the party you work for, so you would have to ask the HR person at your work to see what they are paying the agency.  They may or may not want to release the info, depending on their policies.
1	is it possible to remove water from ammonia? The ammonia doesn't stay behind; it's a gas at room temperature.\nFractional distillation will do it, just like moonshinin' does to ethanol.  Heat the ammonia water and the dissolved ammonia gas will come out of solution at a greater concentration than the water vapor if you control the heat.  But if you're trying to make the water potable you must do many fractions; it's not worth it unless in extreme circumstances.

6	Why did Satan come from Heaven and is tehr scripture to back up your answere? You will find the ¨Why¨ in Isaiah...14.12-14.17.\n\nSatan decided to go into heaven and to raise up his own throne above God´s.  He even thought he would be like God.\n\nBad career choice.  Isaiah 14.09 talks about the maggots and worms that now cover Satan.  \n\nAlso, Ezekiel 28.11 - 28.19.  His heart was lifted up by his own beauty.  God cast him to the ground.\n\nJesus saw him fall already.  Luke 10.18.  He said ¨I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven¨.\n\nThere is the Why and the verses.\n\nBut I also want to show you a different ending than some of the other answers.\n\nHere is another ¨why¨.  For this purpose, the Son of God came to the world, so that he might destroy the works of Satan.  1John 3.8\n\nAnd again...¨because He that is in you is greater than he who is in the world¨ 1John 4.4\n\nJust one more ¨WHY¨.  ¨And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed...it shall stand forever.¨ Daniel 2.44.\n\nHow is it that God plans to cast down Satan, set up a kingdom and destroy the works of Satan, if he really plans to send us all up in a rapture?\n\nFor those who care, I´m Jewish.\n\nThanks for the great question!

0	should tombs be opened? It's supposed to be bad luck to do so, however, IF there is a really good reason to open one, then I think it should be done. Example: DNA samples for court cases. As technology gets better, people are finding better clues to unsolved mysteries and murders by sampling DNA of the deceased. Also, some people who originally were convicted of murder who were actually innocent are given a chance to prove their cases, and find the real perpetrater.

0	The Bible Code (not the da vinci code)? I was readin the book "The Bible Code" recently and it said something about the world ending this year in a nuclear world war started by terrorists... what is your outlook on this and do any of you believe in it since it did predict WWI and WWII? There is no code. God does not keep secrets. The Bible is very Black and white. It is straight forward. Do not fall into trying to decode. That is the work of Satan.\nAs far as the war, you speak of ...YES! Watch Pastor Hagee he will explain the Bible Prophecy. He does not assume or use his own interpretation of what he imagines. He uses the Bible and explains what the Bible means. He interprets the written word in accordance to Biblical knowledge. He is very well educated. The Bible does teach us that man will destroy himself and the earth. Yes, this will occur when Iran, the Imam, uses nuclear weapons to attack Israel. The Imam believes his mission is to kill the Jews in Israel and then to kill Americans. Today, Iran has been acquiring the Nuclear weapons to complete it's believed to be mission.  China has been helping Iran for the past 2 years, to do so. The explained theory is that Imam and Iranians will first attack the Jews in Israel and then infiltrate bombs into America. God tells us to keep our eye on Israel, when the things come to pass there, as foretold, we are headed for the Holy War. The Jews are God's protected people. We are to treat them with love and respect and honor. The Bible is true. I urge people to read it. To pray and build a personal relationship with the Lord. Live to better the world. The most important thing is not that the world will end or how it ends. The most important thing is how we all live our life both now and eternally. Go forth and teach the saving message of Christ to all nations.\nAs the Bible predicts: There are wars, famine, disease, storms, earthquakes and so on throughout the world. There are social problems and people looking for peace and can not find it. There has come the time that brother against brother and so on. The US is at War in Iraq & Saudi. The US has enemies in many countires. This is a time of turbulenece. When China backs Iran and in turn Iran attcks Israel and the US this will result in a major world war.

2	White bumps on fingers..itchy? suddenly the other day these white small itchy bumps appeared on my fingers..what is this caused by..what can i do to ease the itching? warts maybe? But if they suddenly appeared consider poison ivy, dematitis or maybe a fungus.\n\nEither way, hear is the treatments: \nfor poison ivy...don't touch anything and it will clear up within a week. \nfor fungus---use athletes foot creme on the site for about a week (once daily)\nfor dematitis--- try cortisone creme for a week, twice a day. \n\nEither way, most likely it is nothing serious. If it is a wart...just use wart remover. But do this option last as it will take the longest to go away.

She told me and she said i would hate her for it. \nI really get on with her but should i persue this any further. I dont know really because i dont know if we were in a relationship or not. Does going out and huggin and smooching constitue a relationship and  should i stay away now? Well...after a guy and I started dating for a couple of weeks, I slept with a previous boyfriend.  That was the last time I ever slept with another person.  I told the guy because I didn't want him finding out from someone else, and I felt the need to be completely honest with him because I really respected him.  Everything worked out, and the guy and I have been married for 15 years.
2	why do i feel sick,scared and dizzy since i have had a proprioreceptor reflex on my neck? A propioreceptor indicates muscle activity and the awareness of the body and its relationship with the surrounding environment is mediated by sensation.\n\nThe input to the brain stem about this information ( feel sick, scared and dizzy) emanates from the joint and muscle proprioceptors ( such as theone located on your neck), the vestibular centers in the ears, and from the eyes.
5	How can we heat an above ground round pool, 24 feet in diameter, without spending a lot of money? Many years ago someone I knew had used a glass door to generate solar heat for a pool but no one knows what I'm talking about.  We have lots of sun but how do we utilize it on the cheap? With plenty of sun--get some black drainage pipe, the corrugated 3" stuff.  Stretch it out in the sun so the entrance is higher than where you want it to exit.  I get about 10-15 degrees higher water temperature at 25 feet.  Helped us get in the pool a couple weeks earlier and stayed in it for awhile longer.  I found this on the web some time ago, the next step is to build a plastic box and use a coil of the pipe, may increase temp by another several degrees--I haven't figured it was worthwhile yet.

Answers.  Let's see if I can paint you a picture.\n\nImagine that you are in the northern ecliptic sphere looking down on the solar system.  Now imagine that there are points at the edge of the solar system like the face of a clock.  And let's put the Earth at 90 degrees (or 3 o'clock) from the Sun.\n\nMercury would be at aproximately 4:00\nVenus would be at aproximately 8:45\nEarth (we already said) is at 3:00\nMars would be at aproximately 9:15\nJupiter would be at aproximately 8:15\nSaturn would be at aproximately 11:45\nUranus would be at aproximately 4:45\nNeptune would be at aproximately 5:15\n\nHope that gives you a clear picture of the alignment currently.

5	que pensez vous de F. Ribery ? C'est un jeune joueur qui a beaucoup de qualités, mais qui a aussi encore beaucoup de progrès à faire tant dans sa gestion de son effort que dans sa gestion du jeu. Ce que l'on dit de lui est un peu surfait. Il a fait le jeu à Marseille est on en fait le futur Zidane. En remettant les choses dans leurs contexte, on remarque que Marseille n'avait pas grand choses à proposer et donc il était plus facile pour lui de se mettre en valeur. Ensuite, il ne sera jamais je pense le leader de l'équipe de France qu'on attends simplement parce qu'il n'en a ni les épaules ni la mentalité. Il reste malgré tout un joueur de talent qui si il continue à progresser deviendra un des meilleurs joueur français de sa génération.

5	linebaker playes and signals such as what dose black mean or red, and jobs of a linebackers? what is the usual job of a high school linebacker In HS, A linebacker often makes the defensive "play" calls for the team. He will call which back to key on (Fullback or halfback), what coverage the secondary will play (man to man or various types of zone.... and will make calls for the Defensive line to shift left or right or to change fronts. \n\nThe calls that he is responsible for become more sophisiticated as he progresses through a system, and College LBs often have more responsibility than HS, and a Varsity HS linebacker has more responsibility than JV.\n\nAs for responsibilities on the field, some of the other answerers have been spot on. A LB generally is responsible for making tackles, and possibly covering the TE or RB out of the backfield on passing plays. They are also occassionally called on to Blitz...

2	How long can I take HRT? Have taken HRT for 12 years, presently take   1/2 tab  0.625mg Premarin + 1/2 tab 2.5 mg Provera daily. How long can I continue? I am 64 years old and in good health.  I take Approval 300mg daily for high blood pressure. If you are doing well with the HRT and have found the proper formulation for your specific needs, there is no reason to stop taking it at all.  HRT is usually taken for life unless it becomes contraindicated; for right now, since you are doing well and the HRT is conferring protective benefits on your heart and bones (among other functions), there is no reason why you should stop now or anytime soon.  Keep feeling well.

6	How can you legally terminate an renter's lease?  Please, serious replies only.? Recently, my upstairs neighbor has been waking me at 3:00 am every morning.  I've complained to the apartment management several times and yet they won't do anything about the untenable situation.  Since I should be able to expect to sleep during normal hours, does this ridiculous situation release me from the terms of my lease?  Or am I going to have to contact an attorney. There are steps that you can take to break your lease because of the situation, but the situation itself doesn't automatically release you from your lease.\n\nLook up the procedure in your state for a constructive eviction.  There are notice requirements and the landlord has to be given an opportunity to correct the situation.  Notice requirements are determined by the state, and your having "complained" a few times may not qualify.  \n\nYou will probably have to send a certified letter, wait a period of time (10 days, 2 weeks, etc) for action to be taken and then if the situation still has not improved you can break your lease without penalty.\n\nSome landlords do challenge constructive eviction claims.  If they do, you will need a lawyer at that point.
1	What do tha crystal sizes of granite and basalt tell you about where they formed? The larger crystals in granite tell us that it formed deep underground.  Geologists call such rocks intrusive igneous rocks.  Insulated from the coolness of earth's surface, the molten rock (magma--molten rock underground) cooled slowly and the crystals had time to grow large.  Basalt flowed onto earth's surface as molten rock (lava--molten rock on earth's surface) and there it cooled quickly, so the crystals had little time to grow.  Geologists call such rocks extrusive igneous rocks.\n\nThere are other differences between granites and basalts, but I think speed of cooling, related to where the molten rock cooled, answers your question.
2	what fats are good and what fats are bad in the body? The good fats are Monounsaturated Fats  and Polyunsaturated Fats. Monounsaturated fats lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) and increase the HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol). Nut, canola and olive oils are high in monounsaturated fats. Polyunsaturated fats also lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Seafood like salmon and fish oil, as well as corn, soy, safflower and sunflower oils are high in polyunsaturated fats. Omega 3 fatty acids belong to this group.\n\nThe bad fats are Saturated Fats and Trans Fats.\n\nSaturated fats raise total blood cholesterol as well as LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol). Saturated fats are mainly found in animal products such as meat, dairy, eggs and seafood. Some plant foods are also high in saturated fats such as coconut oil, palm oil and palm kernel oil.\n\nTrans fats are invented as scientists began to "hydrogenate" liquid oils so that they can withstand better in food production process and provide a better shelf life. As a result of hydrogenation, trans fatty acids are formed. Trans fatty acids are found in many commercially packaged foods, commercially fried food such as French Fries from some fast food chains, other packaged snacks such as microwaved popcorn as well as in vegetable shortening and hard stick margarine.

1	if every action has an equal an opposite reaction, then how does a man move a box along the floor? There is an answer to this, just that it hasn't occured to me yet! Any help would be appreciated. The man is pushing against the box in one direction, and against the floor (with an equal force) in the opposite direction. The force on the floor is transmitted through his shoes, via a frictional force. And the man experiences reaction forces in his hands and feet (the box and the floor "pushing back")\n\nWhen stationary, or at constant velocity, all the forces balance. As the box starts to move (accelerate), there must be a resultant force in the forward direction, i.e. the forces are not balanced.

Love for someone is when you respect them, want the best for them, want them in your life, care for them, worry about them, miss them when they're gone, etc.  You can feel those things for anyone, your sisters, your children, your friends, even your pet.  \n\nLust is a strong physical attraction, a craving for someone if you will,  that is hard to control, trust me, lol. \n\nIt is difficult to say which comes.  I think it depends on the situation.  If you're friends with someone and then become attracted to them then it is obvious that love would come first.  It varies certainly.
4	Why is service pack2 so much better than service pack 1, and takes up somuch space on a computer? I assume you are talking about Windows XP SP2. It is so much better than service pack 1 because it includes so many more security and performance fixes than sp1. It takes up so much space because it is a lot of fixes, has some new features, and it has an uninstaller. Yes, you can roll back to SP1, so it needs a lot of backup files. Don't ask me why, I don't get it.\nThe new features are Win XP yelling at you if you don't have Firewall or Antivirus software, or if it is off or outdated. Also, it has a lame firewall. Still better than nothing though.

9	What do conservatives use that sexual repressed energy for? Pages? Norfolk, Va. - While the results of the research are preliminary, scientists at the Diminutive Male Genitalia Disorder Research Organization have discovered a genetic link between small penis size and the being liberal. The organization recently began to tabulate data from a two-year study of men with Diminutive Male Genitalia Disorder (DMGD) and has posted the results on its Web site, DMGD.org.\n\nThe subjects of the study varied from men with a slight abnormality in penis size to men with pubis innius, a term for an inverted male pubic region. By tracing what has been identified as the "DMGD gene," an abnormality in the 21st chromosome was discovered. Researchers found that this abnormality appears to be consistently linked to two traits: abnormally small male reproductive organs and the ability to derive joy from liberal activities, which starts with acting out in school and, in isolated instances, can manifest itself in homosexual acts. Research team leader Dr. Brad Uplurch and his colleagues in New Orleans, La., plan to investigate whether DMGD was a factor in making San Fransicko California the home of liberal indecency.\n\n"These findings confirm what we have believed for a long time: Liberals just don't measure up."  "They are apparently overcompensating for their failure to succeed in life by adopting deviant behaviors and delusional attitudes."

8	my husband puts lots of meaning into order and a clean house....even forgetting othter sweter things come firs You never know what you may get in a person - My husband doesnt pay attention to how much work I put into the house everyday - He just assumes it should be done.  They don't mean any harm in it.  It is just how they work.  Men and Women just work diferently and it is up to us to remind them of the other things in life - believe it or not..thats why they chose us.  You have to compromise.  I may not think that some things are very inportant, but he may think that same thing is invaluable.  I have to adjust to make sure he is happy and HE has to do the same.  If you clean up the house to show him that his beliefs are inportant you may have a better chance of getting the attention that you feel is important.  My compromise was .....bear with me.....that if we had sex more often - on occasion we would get back to making love.  It worked.  I work to make sure his needs are met - in all facets of marriage - in return he works on mine.  It is an endless struggle to make sure everyone is happy -- GOOD LUCK

4	What is the difference between .asp and .aspx? ASP is Microsoft's first-generation Web scripting language.\n\nIt's not compiled code; like PHP, it is a series of scripted instructions to the server. The server picks up the page, reads the scripts, does what it's instructed to do, then sends the resulting HTML to the client.\n\nASP works on the Request-Response model: I ask the Web server for something (Request) and it sends back whatever I asked for (Response).\n\nASP.NET is compiled code. It is object-oriented, which means that it uses classes and other data structures to perform requested actions, rather than scripted instructions. \n\nASP.NET uses the Event model. In other words, if you click on this or type in that or make another thing, then something else happens.\n\nASP.NET is more like desktop application programming than ASP.\n\nFinally, ASP is a legacy product, meaning the day is coming when Microsoft won't support it any more.
3	How do I fix the grammar in this sentence? This sentence is using Inclusive Language—Quoting from Biased Material\n\nBack in the 1400s, the laws governing the people were quite specific: “All men shall tithe 10% to the church and pay taxes every six months. All men can attend school until they are 16 years of age.” Substitute "people" or "citizens" for "men" if you're trying to re-write this sentence to be inclusive.\n\nOtherwise I don't see any grammatical errors.  There are a few style points - I would rewrite the first part to: "[Back - optional] In the 1400s, laws governing all citizens were quite specific:"

6	What is the worst job that is out there to do?? Can it be septic tank cleaner?? or port a john picker uper?? anything else out there Anything that you don't like to do or feel undervalued doing can be the worst. Many jobs have unpleasant conditions. There are nurses cleaning and diapering adults everyday, men and women cleaning cesspits, emptying porta-johns and garbage cans.\n\nHow about the well-dressed, highly paid advertising writer who would rather be a farmer? Going in to work each day for the prestige and the money but hating himself for doing it? He'd rather be out shoveling the stuff that other people are picking up. Promising himself that he'll do it when he retires but fearing that he won't live that long.\n\nThere are high prestige jobs and low prestige jobs, high pay and low pay, servile jobs and jobs that don't feel important. In the end it comes down to how each individual feels and what their values are.

5	why women's like women's and why guys like guys? Interesting question.  I think guys like male sports because they can relate to male sports.  Also, I think more women like male sports too..based on media coverage and popularity.  An example is the professional soccer league for women which did not get enough popularity and failed..I still think women are not as enthuisastic to watch some sports. I hope this will change in the future.
0	Why do married Chinese give out AngPau(a red packet contain money) to childrens during chinese new year? it's customary for married couples to give out ang pao (hong pao) because 'married couples' are considered adults.\nang pao signifies 'good luck' & 'may you grow up asap'...\nin the 1960s & way way before that, majority of the chinese are poor people or peasants. so, during chinese new year, the adults gave out ang pao so that the unmarried adults may have good luck in love or career (or good harvest) , to get married soon. then they gave children ang pao, so that they can grow up strongly & taller for that year, & join in their parents to work in the fields.

1	i have a question about fusion.? if nuclear fusion is sustained wouldnt that mean that a sorta of mini-sun kinda thing would be produced? and if so wouldnt this mean that this little sun would behave much the way our real sun behaves. what im thinking is that if we sustained fusion then we would create a kind of sun and if this is a sun then wouldnt it produce radiation making it just as dangerous as nuclear power plants assuming we used this as a power source. The only harmful byproduct of a hypothetical commercial nuclear fusion reactor would be a radioactive structure after a lifetime of use which is of little harm to humans. The daughter products are also much less dangerous then the products of nuclear fission and are easier to control. Unlike fission reactors, the fuel isn't stored in one large vessel. The fuel would be brought into the reactor instead of having the fuel part of the reactor. Thus, you would only have about a minute of fuel in the reactor at any given time.\n\nThe real danger with fission power plants is the fact that all that radioactive fuel is sitting there in the reactor, years worth. It's daughter products are also dangerous and unpredictable. The reason fusion plants would be less dangerous are because of the small amount of fuel used, the lack of any dangerous byproducts other then the actual reactor structure, and the relatively less dangerous (and possibly inert) reactor fuels used.\n\nOf course, there are ideal reaction methods that use nearly benign fuel and have almost no dangerous byproducts.

1	What is the hydrophobic effect in simple terms? All the previous answers are correct. However, with regards to enthalpy and entropy remember what these terms mean. While enthalpy is heat energy, entropy is (essentially) a universal tendency towards chaos. So, hydrophobic interactions decrease the total enthalpy of a system and (according to some fundamental physics) increase the entropy of that same system. The apparent paradox, proteins and lipids forming ordered systems IE. micelles, is disproven when we take into account the ordering of water around these systems. Water molecules become MUCH less ordered when hydrophobic components are allowed to form contacts. This is known as decreasing the hydration shell. Thus, all hydrophobic interactions are typically exothermic in nature and cause an increase in enthalpy of the system. Hope this helps!

6	what is starting pay for medical assistants? Careers are unique to each person and are dynamic, unfolding as a person matures. Unfortunately, turnover is high for medical assistants because of the relatively high workload and comparatively low pay raises offered. Therefore many working medical assistants will eventually elect to leave their jobs for better contracts and positions with higher potential for career advancement and pay.\n\nMedical assistants who gained experience on the job, are certified or registered, have met their continuing education requirements, and received additional training may be able to advance into higher positions, such as becoming a medical office manager. They may also qualify for a variety of other related administrative support positions where they work, such as the medical secretary, medical records clerk, or medical insurance billing and coding specialist. \n\nHowever, wherever it is that they work, their hourly wages depend on the level of experience, and often whether they are certified. \n\nSpecialty physicians often can afford to pay more than a family physician, because they earn more themselves. Medical assistants working in the back office (clinical areas) usually earn a little more per hour than their front office counter parts (admin/reception area). Florida medical assistants earn more than those in South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia. It all depends... \n\nLearn more about this subject at

Derivation  Meri means rebellion. Transliterated to Greek yields the name of Mary, the mother of Jesus. \n\nJones initially reads Their Rebellion. NOBSE reads Obstinacy, Stubbornness.\n\n(2) From  Mar and  Yam meaning sea. \n Mar means bitter;  Mar means myrrh. Both come from the root  Marar meaning be bitter, strengthen, strong.\n Mar probably means drop but is used only once, in Isa 40:15). \nJones (additionally) and Jerome read Stella Maris (star of the sea), but that strikes as a very free interpretation. \nThe name Miriam (Mary) means Bitternesses but also Strong Waters/ Waters Of Strength. \n\nClick here for more info:\nhttp://www.abarim-publications.com/Arie/Names/Miriam.html

1	Where do enzymes come from and what are their purpose? If you removed enzymes from the body, it would stop working and die! Enzymes are responsible for the functions of every organ. The body is a big efficient chemical factory and enzymes are needed for every chemical action and reaction.\n\nEvery gene's program is associated with the actions of enzymes. Even vitamins and nutrients can't be used effectively without enzymes.\n\nThe immune system's function is to fight off all foreign invaders in the body such as bacteria, viruses, carcinogens and other chemicals. It relies almost totally on enzymes to do its job. A weakened immune system has a diminished volume of enzymes which includes those that are defective or worn out. Enzymes have a limited life and must be replaced regularly.\n\nWhere do we get enzymes? Nine basic enzymes come from food, and the body takes these and changes them into over 3,000 varieties for various purposes.

I have given my S.S.c exams and now i am really confused about my field. i have also started a crouse in designing it is always better to do something that you like.animation is a very good field.\n\nwww.animaster.com\n\n"The human visual system is designed with a thing called 'persistence of vision,' so when you blink, the world doesn't suddenly go black, but you have a constant impression of the visual field in front of you” says Carin Perron. \n\nAnimation is the art of capturing a series of individual movements, whether on film or in digital form and replaying them in rapid succession to give the illusion of movement. It can be achieved using images drawn on a cel, paper or other medium, with clay figures or papers puppets or using computer generated images.\n\nAnimation Industry \n\nA recent study conducted by Anderson Consulting states that the Indian animation industry currently pegged at $550 million is slated to clock a growth rate of 30% annually in the next 3 years. In the next three years India would receive more than $2 billion worth animation business, according to the study. If you are a technology savvy artist looking for an exciting working life then this is good news. Meanwhile, Nasscom estimates the current global animation market to be worth around $45 bn and expects it to jump to between $50 bn and $70 bn by next year. It also states that India could use 300,000 professionals in content development and animation by 2008, up from 27,000 three years ago. Poised for growth in India, Multimedia’s usage has expanded not only in the field of Animation but also in Films, Television, Gaming, Music, Internet, Digital products and Services.

Symbiosis involves a relationship by which both partners give something to the relationship.  A pathogen only takes, but does not provide.  \n\nFor A,  the human intestine provides food, and the bacteria produce vitamins.  For B, the bacteria aid in pollination and once again are provided with a food source.  For D, bacteria once again have a food source (and even outcompete) and thus help provide protection.   And E, the bacteria fix nitrogen for the plants' survival and get a place to live and food.\n\n\nThe key to convergent evolution is that the two species are not closely related, eliminating B and D.  The process involves the independent acquiring of similar traits due to similar environmental pressures.  This points us to E.

1	If time slows when nearing the speed of light would light "think" it took less than a year to go 1 light year? I'm puzzled by the time paradox of near-light-speed travel. If time would seem to pass more slowly to a high-speed traveller, why wouldn't it also seem to pass more slowly from the perspective of light, itself? In other words, why do we say that it takes light a year to travel a light year? To us, perhaps, it does, but from the light's perspective, wouldn't it take much less time to go that distance, or even no time at all? And, if not, why not? if you were traveling at the speed of light, which would basically make you light itself, time would never pass and you would be unaware of the concept of time.  \nwhen you talk about the light year, that's a measurement of distance- the distance that something traveling at 180,000 miles per second goes in a year.  i know that it's confusing, because then you get into the concepts of proper and coordinate time, and proper and coordinate distance.\nbasically, if you are traveling at exactly the speed of light, which you cannot do, from your perspective it would take no time to travel anywhere, and therefore you would travel no distance.  it's pretty freaky stuff.\nwe look at it a different way because we have a different perspective and travel at a different speed.\ngosh i love relativity.

1	From control to tension production, explain the key steps involved in the contraction of a skeletal muscle fib List as many details as possiable This may be more than you wanted, but here goes:\n\nSkeletal muscles contract according to the sliding-filament model:\n\nAn action potential originating in the CNS, reaches the axon of the motor neuron. \nThe action potential activates voltage gated calcium ion channels on the axon, and calcium rushes in. \nThe calcium causes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, within vesicles in the axon to fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the acetylcholine into the synapse between the axon and the motor end plate specialization in the sarcolemma of the muscle. \nThe acetylcholine diffuses across the synapse and binds to nicotinic receptors on the motor end plate, opening channels in the membrane for sodium and potassium. Sodium rushes in, while potassium trickles out through the sodium-potassium (Na/K) pump located in the sarcolemma. However, because sodium is more permeable, the muscle fiber membrane becomes more positively charged, triggering an action potential. \nThe action potential spreads through the muscle fibre's network of T tubules, depolarizing the inner portion of the muscle fibre. \nThe depolarization activates voltage-gated calcium channels in the T tubule membrane, which are in close proximity to calcium-release channels in the adjacent sarcoplasmic reticulum. \nActivated voltage-gated calcium channels physically interact with calcium-release channels to activate them, causing the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium. \nThe calcium binds to the troponin C present on the thin filaments of the myofibrils. The troponin then allosterically modulates the tropomyosin. Normally the tropomyosin sterically obstructs binding sites for myosin on the thin filament; once calcium binds to the troponin C and causes an allosteric change in the troponin protein troponin T allows tropomyosin to move, unblocking the binding sites. \nMyosin (which has ADP and inorganic phosphate bound to its nucleotide binding pocket and is in a ready state) binds to the newly uncovered binding sites on the thin filament. Myosin is now bound to actin in the strong binding state. The release of ADP and inorganic phosphate causes the myosin head to turn, causing a ratchet movement (Actin acts as a cofactor in the release of inorganic phosphate, expediting the release). This will pull the Z-bands towards each other. It also shortens the sarcomere and the I-band. \nATP binds myosin, allowing it to release actin and be in the weak binding state. (A lack of ATP makes this step impossible, resulting in rigor mortis.) The myosin then hydrolyzes the ATP and uses the energy to move into the "cocked back" state while releasing ADP and inorganic phosphate. In general, evidence indicates (predicted and in vivo evidence) that each skeletal muscle myosin head moves 10-12 nm each power stroke, however there is also evidence (in vitro) of variations (smaller and larger) that appear specific to the myosin isoform. \nSteps 7 and 8 repeat as long as ATP is available and calcium is present on thin filament. \nWhile the above steps are occurring, calcium is actively pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When calcium is no longer present on the thin filament, the tropomyosin changes conformation back to its previous state so as to block the binding sites again. The myosin ceases binding to the thin filament, and the contractions cease. \nThe calcium ions leave the troponin molecule in order to maintain the calcium ion concentration in the sarcoplasm. The active pumping of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum creates a deficiency in the fluid around the myofibrils. This causes the removal of calcium ions from the troponin. Thus the tropomyosin-troponin complex again covers the binding sites on the actin fiaments and contraction ceases.\n\nThere are two types of voluntary muscular contractions, eccentric and concentric. In the case of eccentric contraction, the force generated is insufficient to overcome the resistance placed on the muscle and

1	why  do  mosquitos always  hang  near our ears? They don't, specifically.  When a mosquito feeds, it has 2 tubes, one to suck blood up to them, and another to pump fluids into you.  One of those fluids is an anti-coagulant (to keep your blood from clotting and keep it flowing freely for them), but the other fluid is a numbing agent so that you don't notice and kill them.  It's because of this numbing agent that you never feel them, you only hear them, and since they're so small and, therefore, quiet, you only hear them when they're next to your ears, making that the only time you notice them.\nSide note:  The bump and itching associated with mosquito bites doesn't show up on everyone.  It's a minor allergic reaction to the anti-coagulant and the numbing agent.  When people say "mosquitos don't bite/like me", it's not because mosquitos don't bite them, it's because they're not allergic like most of us, so without getting the bump and the itching, there's no way for them to tell they've been bitten.

6	how can harassment be prevented at work? The best thing is to give a training video for all new hires, and have a written policy on the companies view on harassment, what constitutes harassment, and what the consequences are.  Most people will behave themselves if they know the organization takes it seriously.  Have each person sign a sheet that they have received the training, so if anything happens, you can show that your organization did not create a workplace permissive of this behavior.

3	Can you have a Stafford Loan coming from more than one place for college? You can use a different lender from year to year.  For example, you can obtain your Freshman year Stafford Loan from Citizens Bank and your Sophomore year Stafford Loan from Citibank.  You will find that this is a little bit of a pain since it will entail completing a new Master Promissory Note for each lender (and might confuse your school a little bit if they are expecting you to borrow from once place and you go elsewhere).  \n\nHaving multiple lenders can benefit you, though, if you plan on consolidating later. See, students who borrow every single student loan from the same lender are bound by something known as the "single holder rule." Simply put, this rule states that a students with loans help by a single lender *must* consolidate with that lender.  So, if all your loans are with Citibank, you must consolidate with Citibank, even if Sallie Mae is offering better borrower benefits.\n\nNow, you probably shouldn't attempt to borrow from two Stafford lenders during the same enrollment period at the same school (for example, if you were awarded $3,500 as a Sophomore, you shouldn't attempt to borrow $1,750 from Citibank and $1,750 from Sallie Mae). While this isn't expressly forbidden, it's... well, weird and could cause a big mess (you could be responsible for an overpayment, your loan disbursements could be delayed, etc.). \n\nKeep in mind that interest rates on Stafford Loans are set by the federal government, so your underlying interest rates on any Staffords will be the same. The only reason you'd want to "shop around" would be to obtain one of the many "borrower benefits" out there for student loan borrowers (interest rate reductions, principal reductions, etc.).  However, it's unlikely that one bank will offer a benefit that's enormously better than another bank's benefit (the borrower benefits will be different, yes, but in the end, they tend to add up to similar savings).  \n\nFor more information about borrower benefits and about the "single holder rule," which is still in effect, check out these pages:\n\nhttp://www.finaid.org/loans/singleholderrule.phtml\nhttp://www.finaid.org/loans/choosing.phtml\nhttp://www.finaid.org/calculators/loananalyzer.phtml

3	I have to write an essay on Ender's Game, i have to write about childhood and if it's needed for a normal life I have to write an essay for my english class on Ender's Game.  I have to write about childhood and if it's needed for a normal life, if Ender could ever have a normal life, if childhood is a "right" or "privilage" and stuff like that.  I am completely out of ideas... Please help.  (i need quotes from the book, and credible sources) the concept of "childhood" as being a relatively carefree, unencumbered period of life is a modern invention.  throughout history, children have been seen as additional sources of labor, as pawns in the furthering of generational schemings, or as miniature adults.  it is only in the past 50-75 years or so that we've let childhood be something other than just a period of waiting until the child could contribute to the household.\n\nWhether childhood is a right or a privilege, however, is not a central question of the story.  The real question is to what extent is a society's actions justifiable in the overall context?  In Ender's Game, the Earth was facing extinction.  To prevent its destruction, the governments of Earth banded together against a common enemy and set up Battle School.  While the stresses and rigors of Battle School had a dramatic impact on the children in the system, in the overall context of species survival, the actions could be justified.  The youth of war-torn countries in Africa can be compared to the Battle School children.  Studies have shown that boys who are inured to the extremes of combat are more vicious and brutal than teens or young adults who undergo the same stresses.\n\nSo a possible path to approach the paper is not to ask if childhood is a privilege vs. a right but to explore whether a normal life is possible and use references to the situation in Africa to justify your point.
4	running widows 98 se, pc frove, un pluged, now all it will do is start up to the hp screen,? The fact that it froze at startup indicates a hardware problem instead of software. While the HP screen is up the computer is running what's called POST, Power On Self Test. it just runs a check on all devices in it to see if they are OK. If it hangs during post there is a problem with a device. There are beep codes that usually sound off indicating where to start looking. A healthy PC will emit one short beep at startup. I included a link for you to research beep codes. If all that seems like too much for ya. Just open up the PC, make sure you're grounded or using an ESD strap.

2	Why Doctors prescribe antibiotic most frequently, while every one knows that these r bad for health?

Doctor's like to make money and they only make money if they have patients who are happy. Therefore, they prescribe antibiotics just to make sure their patients are satisfied.

1	How does a laser work? skyman,\n\nthis is kind of a big question since there are very very many different kinds of lasers that work very differently.  i'll try to answer it in a general way.\n\nLASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.  i'll get to exactly what that means in a minute.\n\nthe earliest laser was a rod of ruby crystal, with mirrors on both ends with the shiny faces pointing towards the crystal, and some very bright flashbulbs around the sides.  one of the mirrors was a perfect mirror - 100% of the light was reflected - and the other was not quite - 99% or so was reflected but about 1% passed through.\n\nthe way it worked was that you'd fire the flashbulbs, which would shine very brightly into the ruby crystal.  all the atoms in the ruby absorb some energy from the light and their electrons go to a higher-energy state - this is called a "population inversion" and is important to the operation of a laser.\n\nanyway, before long some of those atoms will start emitting photons and settling back down into their ground state.  some photons will be going the right direction so that they bounce back and forth between the mirrored ends of the rod, over and over.  \n\nevery time a photon goes past an excited atom, it causes the atom to radiate a photon too, in the same direction and in phase with the original photon.  this is the "stimulated emission" in LASER.  before long this cascades into a torrent of photons, all bouncing back and forth between the mirrors - about 1% of them leak out and you get a laser beam.\n\nthere are a lot of other designs for lasers, but they all work on the same fundamental principle.  you have some kind of material that can emit photons when it's in an excited state, and you put it between two mirrors in what is called an optical resonator or optical cavity.  of course there are a lot more technical details that i'm skipping over, but hopefully you get the basic idea.

3	anciant eygypt help? how was the great pyrimid of giza made (khufu)? Please visit this site, it has more details, i am including some of it here:\n\nThe Pyramids. According to common perception they were built, with the begrudging help of great armies of slaves, by the ancient pharaohs of Egypt as tombs for preserving their royal bodies. Pyramids were meant to be monuments to the pharaoh's greatness, filled with great treasures for the afterlife. To construct these massive shrines, the pharaoh's copied the oldest and largest pyramid of all, the Great Pyramid of Giza.\nBut the Great Pyramid itself contains no pharaoh's body, no treasure chamber, and no treasures. Who, then, designed it and built it? What was its purpose? Let us begin our tour by considering a few basic facts about the Great Pyramid.\n\n\n The Last "Wonder of the World"\n\nThirty times larger than the Empire State Building, the Pyramid's features are so large they can be seen from the Moon.\nIts base covers 13.6 acres (equal to seven midtown Manhatten city blocks), each side being greater than five acres in area.\nA highway lane eight feet wide and four inches thick could be built from San Francisco to New York and put inside the Great Pyramid.\nThe oldest structure in existence, having been started 4,617 years ago, it is the sole remnant of the Seven Wonders of the World.\n Journey to the Center of the Earth\n\nOnly a solid stone mountain could endure the Pyramid's immense weight. And indeed, a flat solid granite mountain happens to be located just beneath the surface of the ground directly under the Pyramid.\nIt is built to face true North.\nThe Pyramid is located at the exact center of the Earth's land mass. That is, its East-West axis corresponds to the longest land parallel across the Earth, passing through Africa, Asia, and America. Similarly, the longest land meridian on Earth, through Asia, Africa, Europa, and Antarctica, also passes right through the Pyramid. Since the Earth has enough land area to provide 3 billion possible building sites for the Pyramid, the odds of it's having been built where it is are 1 in 3 billion.\n Construction Unequaled by Modern Technology\n\nLike 20th century bridge designs, the Pyramid's cornerstones have balls and sockets built into them. Several football fields long, the Pyramid is subject to expansion and contraction movements from heat and cold, as well as earthquakes, settling, and other such phenomena. After 4,600 years it's structure would have been significantly damaged without such construction.\nWhile the bulk of the Pyramid's core was constructed of 4,000- to 40,000-pound blocks of soft limestone, the outer layer of the Pyramid was made of a beautifully bright, protective layer of polished stone. These outer "casing stones" are missing today because about 600 years ago they were stolen by Arabs, (This accounts for the very worn appearance of the Pyramid today, since the inner limestone blocks are not immune to attack by the elements-wind, rain, and sandstrom.) This protective covering was made up of 100-inch-thick, 20-ton block of hard, white limestone, similar to marble but superior in hardness and in durability against the elements.\n\nThe Great Pyramid did not always look as "rough" as it does today.\nOriginally it was encased with a layer of tight-fitting, highly polished 20-ton stone slabs.\n\nThe casing stones, 144,000 in all, were so brilliant that they could literally be seen from the mountains of Israel hundreds of miles away. On bright mornings and late afternoons, sunlight reflected by this vast mirrored surface of 5-1/4 acres distinguished the Pyramid as being visible from the moon. (Note: For those interested in possible symbolic significance, in Bible prophecy 144,000 is the number of people-12,000 from each of the 12 tribes of Israel-who are supposed to evangelize the world at the endtime.)\nThe people of the area had viewed the Pyramid and its polished stones with awe for centuries. But when a 13

6	What came first the chicken or the egg? This is actually very easy to answer, based on evolution the egg had to come first. Evolution works like this: There are slight changes in the genetic information of the sex cells (i.e. eggs and sperm) of individuals that are passed on to the offspring of any two parents. These changes in the genetic makeup are called mutations. Mutations can either have: 1) A deleterious effect on the offspring (genetic disorders may arise, many times these are lethal); 2) sometimes these mutations may be advantageous, making an individual more fit than its neighbors (this is sometimes referred to as conferring an advantage); or 3) these mutations can have no effect, making no change from parent to progeny.\n\nIn the case of the chicken, it must have evolved from something else that became less fit than the chicken and eventually becoming extinct. The chicken became a chicken from this other organism through mutations that built up over time in subsequent generations. However, whatever the genetic makeup that finally became defined as a chicken, that individual was first conceived and developed in an egg before being hatched. The egg and sperm that fused to produce the chicken didn't bypass the period of gestation within an egg that had developed in the bird family millions of years before the chicken came along.\n\nSo the simple answer to this question is the egg came first -- unless you believe in fairy tales?

Kwanzaa (Kwaanza) is a week-long secular holiday honoring African-American heritage, observed from December 26 to January 1 each year, almost exclusively by African-Americans in the United States of America, though Africans of the diaspora in many countries have begun to practice its observances as well.\n\nKwanzaa consists of seven days of celebration, featuring activities such as candle-lighting and pouring of libations, and culminating in a feast and gift-giving. It was founded by black nationalist Dr. Ron "Maulana" Karenga, and first celebrated from December 26, 1966, to January 1, 1967. Karenga calls Kwanzaa the African American branch of "first fruits" celebrations of classical African cultures.

0	can u please tell me the history of valentine day.? The first interpretation has this celebration originating as a pagan tradition in the third century. During this time hordes of hungry wolves roamed outside of Rome where shepherds kept their flocks. The God Lupercus, was said to watch over the shepherds and their flocks and keep them from the wolves. Every February the Romans celebrated a feast called Lupercalia to honor Lupercus so that no harm would come to the shepherds and their flocks. Also during Lupercalia, but in honor of the goddess Juno Februata, the names of young women were put into a box and names were drawn by lot. The boys and girls who were matched would be considered partners for the year, which began in March. This celebration continued long after wolves were a problem to Rome.\n\nAs Christianity became prevalent, priests attempted to replace old heathen practices. To Christianize the ancient pagan celebration of the Feast of Lubercus, the church officials changed the name to St. Valentine's Day. To give the celebration further meaning and eliminate pagan traditions, priests substituted the drawing of Saints names for the names of the girls. On St. Valentine's Day the priest placed saint's names into an urn or box. The young people then drew a name from the container. In the following year, the youth was supposed to emulate the life of the saint whose name he had drawn. \n\nBy the fourteenth century they reverted back to the use of girl's names. In the sixteenth century they once again tried to have saintly valentines but it was as unsuccessful as the first attempt.\n\nWhile it can't be proved historically, there were seven men named Valentine who were honored with feasts on February 14th. Of these men, two stories link incidents that could have given our present day meaning to St. Valentine's Day.\n\nOne of these men named Valentine was a priest during the reign of Emperor Claudius. Valentine was revered by the young and old, rich and poor, with people of all walks of life attending his services. At this time Emperor Claudius was heavily recruiting men to serve as soldiers for his wars without much success. The men preferred not to leave their wives, families and sweethearts to fight in foreign lands. Claudius became angry and declared that no more marriages could be performed and all engagements were cancelled.\n\nValentine thought this to be unfair and secretly married several couples. When Claudius found out, he threw Valentine in prison where he died. Friends of the priest retrieved his body and buried it in a churchyard in Rome.\n\nAnother version had St. Valentine jailed for helping Christians. While Valentine was in prison he cured a jailer's daughter of blindness. Claudius became enraged and had Valentine clubbed and beheaded on February 14, 269 A.D. \n\nYet another story claims that Valentine fell in love with the jailer's daughter and wrote her letters that were signed "From your Valentine."\n\nAll of the seven Valentines eventually evolved into one. In 496 Pope Gelasius declared the day in honor of St. Valentine. Through the centuries the Christian holiday became a time to exchange love messages and St. Valentine became the patron saint of lovers. Lovers' quarrels come under his jurisdiction and, naturally, he is the patron saint of engaged couples and of anyone wishing to marry. \n\n:-)

3	What I need to do to become a sex therapist? I am currently in technical college and in the "Associate of Science" transfer program, but have been considering changing into the "Associate of Arts" program for the fact that the tests I've took said I'm more proficient in arts. My questions are:\n1. Should I keep the science transfer program or go into the art program? \n2. After I transfer to gain my B.A. or B.S. in Psychology, what do I do after to become a sex therapist? Do I need to go into a specialty school or is there another option? The major curriculum requirements will be the same for either a BA or a BS, but most universities identify their Arts degrees as representing that the person has taken at least two years of a foreign language.  The choice, therefore, lies in whether or not a foreign language would be beneficial to your long-term goals.\n\nTo become any form of a counselor, most states require at least a masters degree to acheive licensing to work with lesser issues.  For more complex areas of therapy, not only must one study more psych and counseling techniques but one must also know how to diagnose physical and experiential causes, modes of treatments for each condition, biochemical causations and psychoactive medications which may intercept or relieve the conditions -- or make them worse.  Too, one must learn various research techniques, pertinent laws, case report writing, statistical analysis, legal research, writing of legal case briefs, and a myriad of other related things.  It also involves doing several courses involving practicums, meaning being graded on supervised hands-on practice cases.  It in the end requires doing either one semester or one year of internship in a real clinical setting with professional supervision -- and a doctoral thesis based on fresh research which you generate.  \n\nTo go into community counseling working with individuals or groups on issues of social adjustment, bereavement, and such the training route is less stringent, in some states requiring only a masters in agency or community counseling.  To go into clinical psychology as you suggest you are considering, you are are looking at a masters in psychology topped out by a PhD regardless of what state you are considering.  Guidelines for licensing in clinical psychology are set by the American Psychological Association, who will not sanction anyone who does not meet their standands of education.\n\nBenefits, other than the larger paycheck?  People whose lives can be improved through your efforts.  But if you, as far to many do, plan to go there looking for answers for your own problems, don't.  First, fix yourself so that you can better fix others.\n\nSeveral universities across the nation have very reputable training programs in graduate level psychology and counseling.  Do be sure that the department of the university you choose fully integrates and constantly monitors the APA requirements for licensing.  Good luck

2	what are the names of the different types of std's and their symptons? Human Papilloma Virus: The human papilloma virus is thought to be one of the main causes of cervical cancer. It has also been linked with other types of cancers of the female reproductive system. While HPV can be treated to reduce the signs and symptoms, there is currently no cure for this virus. \n\nHerpes Virus: Herpes is another STD that presently has no cure. However, treatment is available and there are a number of things you can do yourself at home to help relieve your genital herpes. Herpes symptoms include blisters or sores that periodically break out on the genitals. Take a look at our FAQs on genital herpes to learn even more about this uncomfortable STD. \n\nHepatitis: Although there is no cure for those already infected, there is now a Hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine available to prevent the spread of this infection. Many are asymptomatic, however those who do suffer from Hepatitis B symptoms may have many unpleasant discomforts. Even though there is a possibility that the infection will clear up on its own, some people suffer from chronic infections for many years. Treatment is available for chronic sufferers. Other types of hepatitis infections that can be passed through sexual contact include Hepatitis A and Hepatitis C. \n\nHIV/AIDS: One STD that many people are worried about getting is HIV. While new ways of treating this infection can significantly prolong an infected person's life, for far too many people this infection eventually progresses to AIDS and, ulitmately, death. More than 40 million people worldwide are infected with the HIV virus; women account for 50% of those infected. Many people may not realize they are infected, as the HIV virus is often asymptomatic for the first few years. HIV testing is the only sure way to know if you are infected. However, you can take steps to help prevent the infection. \n\nSyphilis: Throughout history, cases of syphilis have been recorded. While this STD has not always been effectively dealt with, nowadays, syphilis can easily be treated and cured. However, as history has shown, without treatment, syphilis symptoms can progress and affect the nervous system and brain leading to dementia and even death. \n\nTrichomoniasis: Trichomoniasis is one of the most common, curable STDs out there. However, symptoms of trich may be mistaken for a yeast infection causing a women to use the wrong type of treatment for her vaginal discharge. \n\nCommon Infections: Chlamydia and gonorrhea often infect a person at the same time. Although the symptoms of chlamydia are different from gonorrhea symptoms, it is not unusual for a person to be asymptomatic. If you are testing for chlamydia, it may be a good idea to also test for gonorrhea at the same time. Both STDs can be cured but can also do damage to your reproductive system if left untreated. \n\nPubic Lice: A very common STD, crabs are very similar to head lice. While the itchy symptoms can be hard to miss, treatment for pubic lice can easily take care of the discomfort these pests can cause. \n \nRare Infections: Some STDs, like granuloma inguinale and chancroid, are not so well known in North America, but that doesn't mean your not at risk of contracting these infections. Other lesser-talked about STDs include nongonococcal urethritis, molluscum contagiosum, and lymphogranuloma venereum. \n\nHope that helped! Check out this site for more info:

1	Plate Tectonic question? What are the major geographical features that are noted around the world that are caused by the movement of the plates? You tend to get big pushed up mountain chains where 2 continental plates are converging, subduction zone volcanism where you've got 1 plate being subducted beneath another (the subducting plate causes partial melting in the mantle and this magma pushes up through the plate above), mid-ocean ridge system where oceanic crust is being pulled apart (if you can find a map which shows sea topography as well as land topography you can have a look at the mid-ocean ridge system - it's pretty amazing, shows the outlines of the plates pretty well, too), and you also get continental rifting and volcanoes where continental crust is being pulled apart, like in Africa.

2	why can't i breathe? i have trouble breathing. i'm only 14 and i'm not overweight or anything...but when i'm breathing i have to do deep breaths all the time and then still i can't get enough air in. it's only been happening a couple of months but now it really worries me. I think you should talk to you parents about this and they may consult a doctor. If you are not smoking, not over weight, you may be asthmatic. Then again i have a great grandson that is 4 months old and needs breathing treatments so, i think before it goes much longer, you need checked out. It just is not right.

6	i like him so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!? how do you tell a boy that you really like him with out looking like a dork?? I like this guy and i think he likes me too but he doesn't know i like him so how am i supposed to tell him that i like him more than a friend??!! I don't know how old you are, but try to hangout with the guy: maybe work on homework together or invite him and his friends to hang out with you and your friends. Pay attention to him but be cool about it-NO tripping, getting over-excited or stalking or acting obsessed. If he gets the clue and tells you he likes you-mission accomplished! If he seems interested but you get the feeling he is too shy to admit he likes you then just casually ask him to hangout, just the two of you this time. If he doesn't seem interested play it cool and let it slide, you don't want to lose a friend and besides there are plenty of guys out there who would like a thoughtful girl like you. Good luck!!!

1	why the sky is blue? The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.\n\nHowever, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.

9	Should a soldier be held accountable for the killings he/she commits? In War, it's okay for a soldier to kill in the name of his country.  But, the Ten Commandments say, "Thou shalt not kill".  Will the soldier go to hell for breaking the commandment or, is he/she exempt because God is on his/her side?  Seriously, does God give special dispensation to people who kill in the name of their religions? I don't believe that God condones any act of killing another and would not view any war as justified. God in infinite wisdom and compassion however, knows that the human race has a lot to learn and I'm sure will forgive the actions of soldiers in a  war.\n\nRather than being concerned about someone "going to Hell" (which I believe takes a lot of hard work to get there), my  biggest concern is for the returning soldiers living in the Hell in their own minds as they remember the horrors they lived through.  Pray that all find peace.

2	Will a fat person be more cut if doing strength training and no cardio? Will a fat person be more cut if doing strength training and no cardio? Will he become more muscular without doing cardio, even though it will take longer? He would definately gain muscle.  Cardio really isnt great for building muscle- especially if you are doing it for a long time (running distance, biking long ways, etc).  Cardio is an equal opportunity burner of stored energy- which is both fat and muscle mass.  There are a couple of problems with fat guys doing only lifting.  The first is that you're a lot more likely to have a heart attack or annurism while lifting if you're real heavy.  The second is that you're not going to look cut when you're fat- the fat just sits on top of the muscle and hides it, so you still look fat, not cut.

1	Which of the following statements from Euclidean geometry is also true in spherical geometry? a) A segment is the shortest path between two points.\nb) Perpendicular lines intersect at one point.\nc) Perpendicular line form four right angles.\nd) A line has infinite length.\n\nI know it's not c, because perpendicular great circles form eight right angles. And I don't think it's d because a great circle is finite and returns to its original starting point. Statement a is true.  B is not true, as distinct great circles (which are the lines of spherical geometry) intersect at two points which are antipodes of one another.  C is not true for the reason you observed, as is D.  Thus A is the only statement that can be true.  Of course, we have to understand what a segment is in spherical geometry.  In Euclidean geometry, a line segment is that portion of a line which falls between two points (this is an informal definition, by the way.)  What is true about line segments in Euclidean geometry is that they are paths of minimum distance between their endpoints.  In other words, every other path between two points is longer than the line segment between them.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, lets talk about segments in spherical geometry.  They will be portions of lines (great circles) between two points.  Notice that, given any two points on a sphere, there is at least one great circle that passes through them (if these points are antipodes, there are infinitely many!)  Here's one difference between Euclidean and spherical geometry:  on a sphere, there are two line segments between these points.  Draw a circle and put two points at random on the circle:  you'll see both segments right in front of you.  One of these will be of shorter length that the other (unless you picked antipodal points, in which case the line segments will be of equal length.)  \n\nSo, what does this have to say about shortest distance?  Great circles are what as known as geodesics, which are constructed as paths which minimize distances between points on a space.  Straight lines are the geodesics of Euclidean space.  This isn't trivial to show.  So A is somewhat true, in that it is true that the shortest distance between two points on a sphere is given by a line segment (portion of a great circle.)  It is not true in that any line segment is the shortest distance between those points.

2	what are the possible adverse effect of erythromycin? Erythromycin often causes gastrointestinal pain (nausea, vomiting, gastric pain, abdominal cramps). High single doses are not suitable; children experience adverse reactions more frequently. There seem to be hepatotoxic reactions with all erythromycin preparations, but they are reversible after the discontinuation of the drug. The transaminases increase in about 10%; jaundice appears in only 1 of 1000 treated subjects. Ototoxic effects are also infrequent and reversible (hearing loss, ringing in the ear). Other rare side-effects include skin reactions, nephritis, fever and eosinophilia, pancreatitis, colitis and myasthenia.
5	Is Bill Cowher superstitious? His Steelers are designated to wear their home jerseys, but Bill Cowher said that they are still on the road, so he elects to stay with the white tops instead of the black.\n\nThey have won 3 straight road games against the tops 3 seeds in the AFC, so does this move make him  superstitious?\n\nI don't know why he does this, Detroit is MUCH closer to Pittsburgh than Seattle, and Detroit is Bettis' home town. This IS a home game for Pitt... There's a different mind set when you're home.  You have the fans, you get to relax, etc.  Cowher doesn't want his team thinking that.  This isn't supersticious, it's smart coaching.

9	does this fall under abandonment laws in ohio? my father passed away in July 05. he was in the middle od a divorce. He lived in Virginia, she moved to ohio.

2	Is eating yogurt everyday  healthy for you?? yes its very healthy its a good source of calcium and for Vaginal yeast infections affect nearly 12 million women each year. Research suggests that when eaten regularly, yogurt-containing L. acidophilus, a culture found in some yogurts, may decrease yeast growth and infection\n\n0ne out of two women and one out of eight men will develop osteoporosis. Studies show that a diet high in calcium can help slow bone loss, thereby preserving bone mass and reducing the risk of developing this debilitating disease. Calcium-rich yogurt may also lessen the effects of osteoporosis among the elderly.\n\n As many as 50 million Americans suffer from hypertension, or high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. When your family eats lowfat yogurt, they're getting calcium, potassium, and magnesium - three nutrients that have been shown to reduce hypertension\n\nNew studies indicate that calcium may reduce the risk of colon cancer. Furthermore, other studies have found that populations that eat large amounts of yogurt, or other fermented milk products, seem to have a lower risk of developing certain types of cancer, especially colon cancer

3	whats the formula for figuring the impact weight of an egg going 60 miles an hour hitting a brick wall? and lets say the egg weighs 8 ounces... Isn't it illegal for eggs to travel that fast?\nEspecially since the presence of a brick wall strongly suggests that this is taking place in an urban area. \n\nYou have a lot of unaddressed variables here:\nAt 8 ounces this is an uncommonly large egg.\n(It could of course be an ostrich egg, which might account for its extreme speed and size.)  \n\nWhich part of the egg hits the wall first?  \nEggs are of course ovoid, and the lateral surface would present a greater surface area to the wall.  \n\nIs the egg still inside the ostrich?  \nThat would certainly skew your results, and would probably skew the ostrich.    \n\nIf it isn't an ostrich egg, the formula below is less applicable,  since present terms are dependent on the mass/viscosity of ostrich eggs.  \n\nHowever, all things being equal, where: \n\ne is the egg's weight in ounces,  \nm is its velocity in miles per hour\nc is the clot who threw it in the first place.  \n\nThe requisite formula proves to be e=mc2\n\nQ.E.D.

1	even though quarks are the smallest indivisible particles they should b made up(see +details 4 cmplt qstn)? they should b made up Constituent particles. Which in turn must be made up of constituent particle. Therefore Every resultant particle is a constituent particle on it's own. Therefore if we stop subdivision of matter doesnt it mean that the so called smallest particle is not made up of anything else?And if it's so,doesnt it mean that it cant exist without a subparticle??And this means that stopping subdivision of particle means simply wiping out it's existence...Umm Am i right?(I want an xplanation for ur answer by the way Not yes or no) There is no definite answer to your question, since science has a limit to how small particles it can detect.  The basic theory in this area is that matter is just a standing wave.  A wave has no weight, but when encased in a sphere, it then has mass.  And mass requires weight.  This weight is so infinitesmally small it cannot be detected.  But these spheres, called photons, are held together with other photons making up quarks, which are held together by Glueon, which in turn makes up atoms, etc.  This is all based on the wave/particle duallity of light.

It takes energy to melt ice or rock.  If the constituents of the unspecified rock react chemically the question would be whether the specific reaction is endothermic (using energy) or exothermic (giving off energy).

There used to be a Superman show, colored, that was on, it wasn't the one with Terri Hatcher, but a different one, it was on around the time Christopher Reeve had his accident, maybe a little after.

Stress, thinking to much, genetic.\n\nIf you feel you have any type of anxiety disorder there are plenty of sites that offer free help on what to do, I dont know what your anxiety symptom is so I cant suggest what you can do. The only thing I can say is if you do feel anxious do other things that keep your mind off of it. Its a pschyological thing and not real so no worries.

1	How does weather affect women going into labor? Barometric pressure always effects water. the woman's womb is full of amniotic fluid (water), so it can expedite the breaking of the water sack, and once that occurs, labor has officially begun.
2	Do liquid diets work? You know, consuming nothing but Cabbage Soup and lemon juice for a month? Starvation dieting always works in the short term. Unless you are only trying to lose weight for an occasion ( like fitting into your wedding dress..) the weight will come back on and probably MORE than you actually will lose. Our bodies will begin to store all foods eaten as a stored fat because of the month long starvation. You'd be better eating 3 meals in smaller portions and only drinking 8 glasses of water if you wanna lose quick and KEEP it off.

8	What to do when your ex is getting married? I was with my ex for a year and found out that he was seeing someone else as well. He is getting married to the other woman in a couple of weeks and is still trying to keep contact with me. I have tried to cease contact with him and he still keeps coming around. I have even threatened to contact his fiancee if he does not leave me alone but he still wont go away. Although I am very irritated with him and do not desire to be with him, I still have not gotten over the feelings of hurt. The wedding date is coming up and I am nervous and unsure about how I will handle the man that I still have feelings for marrying someone else. Any suggestions on what I should do on his wedding day to keep my mind of off him and the situation? Thanks in advance for your feedback. It's simple. Show up wearing something absolutely stunning. Sit through the boring service then at the reception have a drink, laugh with your mutual friends and make it clear your over it. Bringing a date is a great move. If you're asked for a speech make sure you're funny but also take the opportunity to dish some dirt. Also be sure you leave early before the bride and groom do. You wanna cut your ties so make sure you get things out of your system, and show him that he's giving you up for good and show him what he's missing before you go!
2	My cousing speaks with a lisp... is he gay? Or is this a normal occurence in heterosexual males? Lisps are naturally occuring condition caused by the tongue and its contact with the teeth or the palate, depending on if it is a dental or palatal problem. Sexual orientation is irrelevant to the issue.\nThe "gay lisp" you're thinking of is an affected pattern of speech, not an unconscious practice.
5	who will be the rookie of the year next season? Rodney Carney maybe. He's super athletic and has good shooting skills
6	How does one get over the fear of investing in stocks... i am risk averse and prefer a CD instead.? Start small. Set aside a portion of cash/savings you are willing to risk. It is highly unlikely you will much or all of its value, especially if you invest in a large corporation like Coca Cola or Anheuser Busch. Buy a book or books (or research on the Web) 'How to Invest in the Stock Market" so you become familiar w/ investing terms. \n  Open an account w/ a broker such as E-Trade or Ameritrade, its easier than you think, and transfer the money into the account. Its free and I am pretty sure that uninvested money earns interest (not much 2-3%). Now where these brokers make their money is when you buy and sell stocks. E-Trade charges 14.99 for each trade regardless if its 1 stock or 100, so be careful, especially if your nor investing a whole lot of money, you don't lose your 'profit' to commissioning fees. If you buy stock you should carefully research the company you are buying into and be prepared to hold on to that stock for the long term. Short term fluctuations in the stock (especially losses) can make you nervous and may make you want to 'cut your losses'. Stick with your choice. \n  I was like you about the Stock Market. The majority of my investments are in mutual funds and bonds. I invest in the market as a 'hobby', its fun to track your stocks and try to beat out the big guys. I have made money over the last few years (still gotta keep the day job though) and have learned a few lessons the hard way.\n  1) Don't 'risk' more than your comfortable with to start. If you can't sleep because your worried about your Yahoo stock, your in too deep.\n  2) Open a brokerage account. If you are really nervous use an established brokerage house like TD Waterhouse or Merrill Lynch, though they want a large opening stake, usually around $5G, to open an account. They will offer advice on stocks but the brokers don't always have YOUR best interest in mind. I use E-Trade and read the Wall Street Journal (because I'm cheap and think I know it all).\n  3) Have fun and Good Luck!\n\nPaul
4	how to enchance computer speed so that it work smoothly? The speed of a computer depends on various factors. RAM and the Processor are examples of hardwares which determine the computer speed. Other factors are software related factors such as Presence of Anti virus and Anti spyware etc decreases speed, Full harddisc decreases the speed, Presence of large hard disc partitions also decreases speed.\nFor increasing your computer's speed you can add some more RAM to your system. You can make smaller hard disc partitions. In addition to this regular use of disc defragmenter and disc cleanup also  increases speed to some extent.
6	Would you like to feel LOVE towards MONEY? My friend Klaus Joehle wrote a book "Money is Love". In this book he shares the method he previously used to create big and small stuff. This time he records a creation of $3.6 million. http://lovebook2.tripod.com/book-money-is-love.shtml\n\nHow? In short it's like this:\n1) first he teaches himself he already has this money. (Just imagine it for a second now!)\n2) Then he teaches himself to feel LOVE towards MONEY. \nThis makes his subconscious mind to work in the direction of attracting wealth and money.\n\nIt does work for me. I don't do everything in the book, but the little I did made me feel positive towards money and I already have more money than before.\n\nSome may think that "money is evil". But what if we used chicken instead of money? Then chicken would become evil? :)\n\nSo: Would you like to feel MORE POSITIVE towards money? Would you like to feel LOVE towards money? Money is a worth while goal but has nothing to do with evil or love.
9	What is the difference between Nick Griffin and Mizanur Rahman (UK)? Both appeared in court for the same crime - but one was cleared of charges and the other convicted. Is this yet another surreal way of how British law deals with sensitive cases, or are the purviewers thereof showing their true colours? Both are racists, spouting extreme views and both should have been convicted.\n\nThe difference? Rahman is an extremist nutter, who talks shite and nobody actually listens to. He is wrong to say what he said and deserved jail, but since no-one took him seriously, he posed no threat and did not incite violence. However, the law deals with his intention, and that was certainly to incite violence. The fact that he didn't succeed is neither here nor there.\n\nGriffin is an intelligent manipulator of his group of thugs who hang on his racist words like mad dogs.\n\nThe fact that Griffin spoke at  a closed meeting is irrelevant. His words were intended to incite crimes of violence and arson against non-whites by his half-witted foot soldiers. He should have been convicted.

7	Who do you have more respect for: actor turned singer or singer turned actor? Examples of singer turned actor: jessica simpson, snoop dogg\nExamples of actor turned singer: hilary duff, lindsay lohan\n\nI have more respect, though not much, for the actor turned singer, even though there aren't any good ones.  Hilary Duff can't singer, and neither can Jennifer Lopez.  But I just think that the singer turned actor is trying to get more publicity, attention, and money. neither, they just use their fame to try and make money, they have one strong talent and should stick with that, its pathetic, like jessica simpson
0	How were chopsticks discovered? Imagine you're a caveman with no tools to eat food.  Do you choose two sticks as your food-eating tool?  How the heck did that happen? This was on discovery channel, incidentally, when I chanced upon your question.\n\nIn the past as cavemen, the Chinese people had discovered rice for quite a while, using various ways to cook rice or meat, such as hollow bamboo, mud, and leaves.\nWhen it was hot, they probably used sticks: two sticks like a pair of tongs to hold the packet or the bamboo together.\nSlowly, it evolved from sticks, to wood, and as the Chinese flourished into a civilisation, it was decorated with laquer, made from jade, carved from Ivory, and it's uses increased from just being a tool to pick up food, to being used in quick cooking like stir-frying, to picking scraps of food off the plates, to even cutting chunks of food at the table or in the wok through a skillful manipulation of the fingers and wrists.\nThis ubiquitous tool spread to Korea, Japan and to many parts of Asia where the Chinese migrated, and brought their culture along with them.
3	what is the most children one woman has given birth to? 69, (seriously) to my knowledge.  Most of her babies were born in multiples; and all survived to adulthood.
5	catching catfish? I love to catfish and love to catch monsters what is the best way to catch them so tell me how can I catch them First of all, you had better have the tackle to land the monsters.Sure, people get lucky every year and land a 50 pounder on a bluegill outfit, but I wouldn't reccomend it.if you need help picking out the right equipment, grab a copy of Infisherman Catfish Guide, and it will help you chose what equipment is best for you.I personally use Abu Garcia 6000's and 7000's reels.Okuma reels are also great for catfishing.For rods, I like Bass Pro's Spiral Graphite Musky rods, and thier Power Plus musky rods.Both of these rods are inexpensive, but very strong and dependable.Line is a personal issue.I like Berkley XT Solar and Big Game line.Get you an assortment of hooks in sizes from 10, for catching bait, to 10/0 for huge shovelheads and blues.Sinkers, floats, stringers, swivels and a few more odds and ends are all that is needed to catch giant cats.Now,as to where you fish, it really isnt that hard.Most states have huge populations of cats, and picking what lake or river to fish is easy.In rivers, try to find a hole that has both depth, and cover.A log jam, boulders, rip rap,man made cover, such as a wing dam, or anything that a cat can hide in.In one creek I fish here in Ohio, the best hole has old car bodies sunk in it.In lakes, find some heavy cover, logs, rocks, boat docks, stumps, etc., in at least 5 or 6 feet of water.Remember, the shallower the water, the heavier the cover must be.Cast your bait close to the cover, and stick your rod in a rod holder, and set the bait clicker or open your bail to allow the fish to run line off when they pick up your bait.Bait should be fresh and lively for your biggest cats.Yes, chicken liver is wonderful bait, but the largest cats will rather have live food.Bait can be anything that is legal in your state.Sunfish, shad, suckers, carp, yellowbellies, to name a few.Just make sure of what is legal where you are fishing.Good luck.
2	good diet please? High protein...avoid breads as much as possible, a lot of greens, a lot of water, daily vitamins. Good amount of exercise, and you should be okay. Also, don't completely steer clear of the foods you love, allow yourself a good treat once a week or so, but eat in moderation. Do muscle increasing exercises, muscle burns more calories then fat, so you can burn more calories while doing sedative actions.

2	How am I suppose to.....? M'kay I REALLY wanna know how to make my thighs smaller and my calves! I wear....a size 11 in teans jeans and I want my legs to be smaller! So PLEASE HELP! Should I...stretch and go for a run?\n\nAlso:\n\n           How many crunches should I do to make my stomach flat? Right now I'm able to do 30 crunches without stopping and then I switch to pushups which I can do 20. Then I repeat this 5 tmes. Should I contunue to do this also? For your legs:  biking, jogging, elliptical trainer, squats, dancing, kicking, stair climbing though not TOO much as you don't want bulging muscles.  They should just become firmer with all that exercise.\n\nFor your stomach:  Continue with the crunches but when you come up, turn to one side then down, then come up and turn to the other side. That will help develop your 'oblique' muscles in your abdominal section.\n\n Also, while you're on the floor, lift your head, put your hands behind your neck and lift your legs with your knees bent.  Now move your legs like you're pedalling a bike and alternate pointing your right elbow to your left knee when it's up, then your left elbow to your right knee.  \n\nKeep up the good work with the pushups but remember that your arms have other muscles so lift heavy objects and pull too.
9	is it illegal to purchase the book "behold a pale horse"? i want to read it because i heard it contains great info. but my cousin said i'll get in trouble if i buy it? why? It's not illegal to buy the book, but perhaps the contents of the book may be controversial. I haven't read the book, but heres a summary of the "Behold A Pale Horse" from wikipedia.\n\nBehold a Pale Horse is a 1991 book by William Milton Cooper. (ISBN 0929385225)\n\nWritten after Cooper had been a member of the US Naval Intelligence Briefing Team of the Commander in Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, the book details many of Cooper's claims about the alleged influence of UFOs on US government agencies, the New World Order, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the Apollo hoaxes and other topics.\n\nAnother claim made in the book pertains to his own death. William Cooper, seemingly paranoid, claimed that he would be shot to death on his own property. True to his "fate," he was gunned down in precisely this manner years after publishing the book and settling down in Arizona. However, prior to his move, Cooper had confided to a neighbor of many years that he expressed a wish to be involved in a shootout with Federal employees in order to vent his anger about the government.\n\nThe title of the book alludes to a passage in the Bible, Revelation 6:8: "And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him."

1	what is the meaning of 'part programming' in relation to CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines? The reason for strict program formatting is consistency. Once you have a format that works, use it. If you use the same format (or structure) for all programs you write, you will be able to repeat past successes. If all programmers in your company use the same format for a given CNC machine, each programmer will be easily able to work on another's program.

I don't think it would have gotten the votes it did unless that was a requirement. \n\nOveral it can be a starting point to allow us to monitor more closely the nuclear decisions made in India. You don't know what the cook is doing unless you can get into the kitchen. \n\nIf it works, security would be the best outcome. If it doesn't, we can stop providing the nuclear material.

1	to a natural horizon - ie no hills in the way - how far is the horizon - in miles please? How far away the horizon is depends on the height your eyes are at.  A taller person will be able to see farther than a short person, and a person at the top of a building or other tall object will be able to see much much farther.\n\nFor a person of average height standing in a featureless field  (i.e. the ocean) the horizon would be about 3 miles away.\n\nThis website: http://www.boatsafe.com/tools/horizon.htm  will give you the distance to the horizon based on your height.
5	were was volleyball invented? On February 9, 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts, William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette as a pastime to be played preferably indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from tennis and handball. Another indoor sport, basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles (sixteen kilometres) away in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts only four years before. Mintonette (as volleyball was then known) was designed to be an indoor sport less rough than basketball for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.

0	what is  the origin of life? Research into the origin of life is a limited field of research despite its profound impact on biology and human understanding of the natural world. Progress in this field is generally slow and sporadic, though it still draws the attention of many due to the gravity of the question being investigated. A few facts give insight into the conditions in which life may have emerged, but the mechanisms by which non-life became life are still elusive.\n\nFor the observed evolution of life on earth, see the timeline of life.\n\nResearch into the origin of life is the modern incarnation of the ancient concept of abiogenesis. Abiogenesis, in its most general sense, is the generation of life from non-living matter. The term is primarily used in the context of biology and the origin of life. Abiogenesis was long considered to be a very common occurrence until the Law of Biogenesis (omne vivum ex ovo or "all life from an egg") became firmly established in modern biology as a result of the work of Louis Pasteur.\n\nCharles Darwin in a letter to J.D. Hooker of February 1st 1871, made the suggestion that life may have begun in a "warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, lights, heat, electricity, etc. present, that a protein compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed." Thus, it is the presence of life itself, operating in an oxygen rich atmosphere, itself a product of life, which prevents "spontaneous generation" from occurring on Earth today.\n\nThis modern definition of abiogenesis is concerned with the formation of the simplest forms of life from primordial chemicals, in an environment regarded as similar to that at the time shortly after the formation of the Earth. This is significantly different from the concept of Aristotelian abiogenesis, which postulated the formation of complex organisms. This article reviews different hypotheses for modern abiogenetic processes that are currently under debate.\n\nThere is no truly "standard" model of the origin of life, however most currently accepted models build in one way or another upon a number of discoveries concerning the origin of molecular and cellular components for life, which are listed in a rough order of postulated emergence:\n\nPlausible pre-biotic conditions result in the creation of certain basic small molecules (monomers) of life, such as amino acids. This was demonstrated in the Urey-Miller experiment by Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey in 1953. \nPhospholipids (of an appropriate length) can spontaneously form lipid bilayers, one of the two basic components of a cell membrane. \nThe polymerization of nucleotides into random RNA molecules might have resulted in self-replicating ribozymes (RNA world hypothesis). \nSelection pressures for catalytic efficiency and diversity result in ribozymes which catalyse peptidyl transfer (hence formation of small proteins), since oligopeptides complex with RNA to form better catalysts. Thus the first ribosome is born, and protein synthesis becomes more prevalent. \nProteins outcompete ribozymes in catalytic ability, and therefore become the dominant biopolymer. Nucleic acids are restricted to predominantly genomic use. \nThe origin (see Origin of organic molecules) of the basic biomolecules, while not settled, is less controversial than the significance and order of steps 2 and 3. The basic inorganic chemicals from which life was formed are methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), water (H2O), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), and phosphate (PO43-). As of 2004, no one has yet synthesized a "protocell" using basic components which has the necessary properties of life (the so-called "bottom-up-approach"). Without such a proof-of-principle, explanations have tended to be short on specifics

The deity Muslims worship is referred to in Islam as "Allah", which is really the Arabic word for God (descended from the Aramaic word for god, which translates as "Elah").  \n\nIn reality, Muslims worship the Hebrew god אֶהְיֶה ( and you should read that name from right to left instead of left to right as you would if the name was written in English, since Hebrew is written in the opposite direction).\n\nThe name of the God, should you need a way to pronounce it in English, can roughly be translated as Yahweh, or more loosely as Jehovah.  \n\nIt is the same god worshiped as the god of Creation and the Universe in Judaism, and in Christianity as well, since both Islam and Christianity descend from Judaism and are seen as different, updated ways the one true god of the Hebrews has instructed mankind to worship Him (the practical upshot of which is that while all three religions worship the same god, none of the three see the other two as really being valid since, in all three cases, each religion views the other two as being in error about god's will... the Jews because they do not believe either Jesus or Mohammad and their teachings are valid... the Christians because they believe the teachings of Jesus and his interpretations leading to Christianity render the other two invalid, and the Muslims because they believe the teachings of Mohammad and his interpretations leading to Islam do the same).

2	how should i treat a hurt tailbone? this morning i slipped and fell down some stairs, landing on my tailbone.  any advice on how to treat it?  it's very sore! Yep, I did something similar years ago.\n\nI saw a doctor who told me to avoid sitting for six months and that is what I did.  I didn't sit at the table for meals, I avoided any car rides of more than fifteen minutes or so, and in general I just didn't sit.  Sometimes it was embarrassing, like at conferences when I'd stand instead of sit in the chair, but it did pay off.\nGood luck to  you.

9	does this fall under abandonment laws in ohio? my father passed away in July 05. he was in the middle od a divorce. He lived in Virginia, she moved to ohio.  I was the only one to go to Virginia and get all of his belongings, including his bass boat which was paid for.  However it was titled to my father and My stepmother.  I have now had the boat stored since july 05.  She has made no attempts to to retrieve the boat. She has only asked for the title. She has attempted to make me pay well over market value for this boat.  I was wondering if this might fll under the ohio abandonment laws.  If so, how do i go about getting it in my name.  Thank you for any and all help i this matter.This boat was his prize possesion as it is the same to me.  Very hard to part with this boat. If you have proof of the attemps to contact her to come get the boat and she has refused, then the boat is legally abandoned.  I don't know Ohio law, but in most places, after 30 days, it is considered abandoned.
3	our daughter will not talk to her teachers or any one other than family members she will talk to other kids? Here's an article from TIME Magazine that should provide some comfort and ideas for you:\n\nWhy Abby Can't Talk\n\nShe has a condition called selective mutism that is neither as rare nor as hopeless as experts believed. But the right help is hard to find. \n\nAbby Barnes' hand shoots up nearly every time her teacher asks the 19 squirmy first-graders in her suburban Philadelphia public school to match letters of the alphabet to the sounds they make. Sitting up front with her pinchable cheeks framed by long blond hair, Abby, 7, looks as eager as any of her classmates to blurt out an answer. But every time the teacher calls on her, Abby freezes. Her face tightens. She strains to respond. And even if an answer manages to get past her lips, her words are inaudible. She's effectively mute throughout the school day--even at recess, where the closest she will come to open communication is words whispered to a trusted girlfriend.\n\nAt home, however, Abby is a different child. She loves to play cards and board games and frolic with her brother Jack, 5. "She speaks loudly--sometimes too loudly--and can be bossy toward her brother," says mother Lisa Barnes, who runs the trading desk at a money-management firm. Abby is, in every other way, a perfectly normal child who has no shortage of extracurricular activities, including horseback-riding lessons and dance classes that she's been attending since she was 4. "Performing in public is fine," says her mother. "She likes people to look at her and applaud."\n\nSo why doesn't she speak up in class? What may at first glance look like shyness or obstinacy is actually something far more complex--and much more interesting. Abby, like hundreds of thousands of kids across the U.S., is suffering from a little understood but increasingly recognized childhood disorder called selective mutism.\n\nThe key to selective mutism, or SM for short, is the seemingly incongruous behavior Abby exhibits: voluble in private, silent in public. According to the official psychiatric diagnostic manual DSM-IV, a child who has developed normally at home but has not talked at school or in other social situations for at least a month is a strong candidate for a diagnosis of SM. Experts once believed that fewer than 1 in 1,000 kids developed the disorder, but an influential study three years ago in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry put the prevalence at closer to 7 in 1,000, making SM almost twice as common as autism.\n\nSM can strike at any age, even among children who once talked in public, but it usually becomes obvious by age 3 or 4, when peers are happily jabbering away. About 30% of kids with SM also have a developmental speech impairment, which can exacerbate the problem but is generally not the cause. In the past doctors often recommended speech therapy, but treating the physical or neurological issues alone will probably have little impact on the underlying psychological factors behind SM.\n\nThe root of the problem in most cases is an extreme form of social anxiety or phobia. "It is a fear that can literally make it impossible to speak," says Dr. Elisa Shipon-Blum, a Philadelphia-based clinician who specializes in treating selective mutism. As with most social anxieties, SM is more common in girls and is believed to have a strong genetic component. About 70% of kids with SM have an immediate family member who also struggles with social anxiety.\n\nCompared with childhood disorders in which children are disruptive and disorderly-- such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)--selective mutism gets less attention and considerably fewer research dollars. "These children are ignored because, let's face it, they aren't causing anyone trouble. They are literally left alone and forgotten about," says psychologist Lindsey Bergman, associate director of the UCLA child and adolescent OCD [obsessiv
6	Anyone out there frustrated about their credit rating? Heres the deal: Im 20 years old, I have had credit history for about 3 years I have done excellent with making my payments and also paying off my credit, however I only have an Average rating and Its tough to get approved for anything.... grrr Establishing a great credit rating can be challenging. But there are some steps you can take to significantly improve your rating if you know what to do (and what not to do).\nFor example, don't open up a bunch of low-limit credit cards. Each time someone does a credit check on you, it may affect your actual score (lowering it)... \nI'm not a financial advisor, but I did get some great tips from a reputable one. I really recommend you talk to someone you or your family has already dealt with, like a mortgage broker or loans officer, or even someone at your bank...
0	What is the significance of keeping fast(vrat)? Fasting for religious and spiritual reasons has been a part of human custom since pre-history. Vrat is fasting in Hindism. They obseve fasting for various reasons.Fasting is a very integral part of the Hindu religion. Individuals observe different kinds of fasts based on personal beliefs and local customs. Some are listed below-\n\n- Some Hindus fast on certain days of the month such as Ekadasi (the eleventh day of each lunar fortnight) or Purnima (full moon). \n- Certain days of the week are also set aside for fasting depending on personal belief and favorite deity. \n- Fasting during religious festivals is also very common. Common examples are Shivaratri or the 9 days of Navratri (which occurs twice a year in the months of April and October/November during Dussera just before Diwali, as per the Hindu Calendar). Karwa Chauth is perhaps a form of fasting unique to the northern part of India where married women undertake a fast for the well-being, prosperity, and longevity of their husbands. The Fast is broken after the wife views the moon through a sieve after sunset. \n\n- Methods of fasting also vary widely and cover a broad spectrum. If followed strictly, the person fasting does not partake any food or water from the previous day's sunset until 48 minutes after the following day's sunrise. Fasting can also mean limiting oneself to one meal during the day and/or abstaining from eating certain food types and/or eating only certain food-types. In any case, even if the fasting Hindu is non-vegetarian, he/she is not supposed to eat or even touch any animal products (i.e. meat, eggs) on a day of fasting.\n\nOthr religions like, Muslims, Sikh, Jains, Jews also observe fasting due to certian religious beliefs of their own.-

8	HELP! What to do with my husband? Not sure of what he's REALLY doing!? I know I've been asking for advice about my husband. However, things seem to be getting worse and I haven't spoke to him in 4 days. I tried to tonight when I got in from work, but he seemed a little bit upset that "I woke him up to actually talk to him because he was in a deep sleep". My husband doesn't go to work anymore, he's on FMLA every week for the past 11 months, most of the time in consecutive weeks, doesn't help around the house, except to do the dishes when he feels like it, my parents have our 2 children almost every day while I am at work and he is not, he's ALWAYS gone from home, usually 2 to 5 or 6 hrs. at a time and doesn't even call. He's been telling me little lies all the time, such as I'm returning something to my friends house real quick and I'll be right back, but doesn't show up back home until hrs. later, or I have to go check on his place that his sibling is living in because she thinks the stove caught on fire only to tell me an hour and 1/2 later Good grief. Sounds like you need someone to TALK with; I don't mean counseling, it's gone way beyond that. I mean someone who knows you, is a good friend, & can give you some input. You have gotten a lot of sincere, & thoughtful answers, however, if he is "cheating" on you or not, there are so many more issues with this "man." & sweetie, I have to say--while it may seem pragmatic to advise you to split, to kick him out, or whatever--& I AGREE--I don't see how you can continue with the stress he's putting you through, if you choose to, it won't be easy.  He's not supporting your children NOW, & it would take money to get a divorce, & where would the child support come from? All this considered, you DO have to think about YOURSELF. You say you're not sure of what he's REALLY doing. You KNOW what he is NOT doing.  Whether you wake him from sleep or not hardly matters, do you think? This person isn't someone you can "talk it out" with.  Please just consider ALL your options, put YOURSELF FIRST; you're of no use to your children in the state you're in--come to the very best conclusion (basically a no win in any case) based on how you truly feel--in a way, it seems you've enabled him far too long. But whatever you choose, based on your emotions, finances, whatever, choose carefully & stick to it. I wish you the best, in a situation that has no "easy" solution. OK? It would help--at the moment--to talk to a friend who won't dictate to you, or judge you. You need to get this "out" in a forum other than this. I left my second husband after abandoning my profession to take care of his, only because I knew I was losing my autonomy & self respect. It was a long road back to where I'd been. Fortunately, I didn't have any children. I wish I knew more about YOU & perhaps I could be of more help. BE STRONG.

And it infuriates me.  I once read that something that is common to every human being is that we want to be valued.  When someone totally ignores what I've said, and thinks it's so cool when they find out about it somewhere else later, or, when the bozos "discover" it themselves and have no recollection that I was the one that told them about it, it is such a de-valuing experience.  It makes me angry, it makes me want to do ANYTHING to get them to give me some credit.  And the sad thing is, it happens all through life, not just when you're young.  The only thing I can do is try to never dismiss people in my life, and to value what they say.

The sun is more or less at the same distance from the earth on the same day so why does the sun appear so large during dawn and why does the moon appear large during moonrise??? It is an illusion. People tend to perceive objects on the horizon as larger than they really are, but you can destroy the illusion by looking at the horizon upside down. Really! I have tried it. And it is not only the Moon, but trees and buildings too. As you tilt your head more and more things on the horizon start to look smaller. I notice that sideways is enough tilt for me to see things on the horizon as noticeable smaller than when looking upright. The usual suggestion is to bend over and look at the horizon between your legs, but that is just to embarrassing for me so I tilt my head sideways until I am looking upside down to one side of my legs and notice the size changing when I am about half Way to being upside down. Try it, it is easy!

Suppose that one lift costs $2 million, and preparing the slope and installing the lift costs another $1.3 million. The lift will allow 300 additional skiers on the slopes, but there are only 40 days a year when the extra capacity will be needed. (Assume that Deer park will sell all 300 lift tickets on those 40 days.) Running the new lift will cost $500 a day for the entire 200 days the lodge is open. Assume that the lift tickets at Deer Valley cost $55 a day and the added cash expenses for each skier-day are $5. The new lift has an economic life of 20 years OK.  Now I have done all that assumption, what is it exactly that you would like to know?\n\nFYI, I like the name of the lodge.  I would go there with my kids.  If they were big enough to ski.

1	what is the number of electrons in kryton? Krypton has 36 electrons.  It's atomic number is 36 which means it has 36 protons.  Because atoms have the same number of electrons (negative charges) as they do protons (positive charges) then it must also have 36 electrons.\n\nDon't get atoms confused with ions - an ion is an atom that has a positive or negative charge... meaning that it has more or less electrons than it does protons.\n\nAn atom can't have more or less protons without it becoming something else.  If Krypton had one more proton it would be rubidium, if it had one less it would be bromine.\n\nBy the way, kryton (or Kryten) was a character in the TV series Red Dwarf and he would have had squillions of electrons.

ALTHOUGH, I DO RUN INOT DIFFICULTIES WHEN I COMPLETE MY TRANSITION INTO THE FULL *PLOUGH*. AFTER I RELEASE THE POSE, I FIND MYSELF WITH A TERRILE HEADACHE FOR THE NEXT 2 DAYS. THIS HAS HAPPENED FREQUENTLY. ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEAS? This is not a good sign. Something is wrong for sure, but from your description I cannot tell what it is. I'd strongly recommend you to do either of the below:\n1. Find a good teacher and show him/ her how you do the pose for diagnosis\n2. If you cannot afford #1, stop doing the pose\n\n#1 is preferred to #2 if you can afford.\n\nIf you intend to continue learning on your own, remember this: Despite all the potential benefits of yoga, it can also do harm if not careful.

9	CARPET BOMBING! Isn't  more heinous than suicide bombing? We have learnt that in carpet bombing, bunker bursting, etc. it is impossible to ascertain casualties, both targeted and collateral. Carpet bombing has not been used in Iraq.  Generally it is a technique used in warfare where there are massed troops and that doesn’t meet needs in terrorists based wars.\n\nBunker bursting bombs are very different from carpet bombing.  They are part of the targeted bombing techniques and are used to get very specific sites or small groups of the enemy.  \n\nBoth carpet bombing and smart bombs are used to target military.\n\nNone of these bombing techniques are comparable to suicide bombing.  Suicide bombing is targeted at civilians and is used to terrorize a society. \n\nAll bombing has the common characteristic of killing and injuring those outside of the targeted area and group because that is the nature of bombing.  It is the intent of those doing the bombing which is important.  Do they intend to hit militants or do they target civilians.  Currently, it is the terrorists who intend to kill and harm civilians.
8	Anyone near Apple Valley or Lakeville, Minnesota? There are 2 kittens that need a loving home for 6 months. I will pay you to do this.\n\nFor more info, IM this person: hot_one032004 (yahoo screen name) I suggest you put an ad in your local newspaper or penny saver, a Supermarket Bulletin board, or a Church events calendar. This way you can be assured if someone local cares for the kittens you'll get them back in 6 months. Also if you continue to advertise here your going to get more useless comments like the 2 above me that were clearly only posted so the participants could get the points. I hope I offered you some constructive advise. Good luck.

6	Debate the ethics of doing business in countries with totalitarian governments.? It's same type of ethics for doing any sort of shady business.

4	I have a apple powerbook g3 with 9.2.2 installed and I'm trading it for a windows 98 SE. is it a good trade That really isn't an upgrade.  Windows 98 was essentially Windows95 with a new logo and a bunch of bug fixes.  Most useful programs coming out now aren't going to run well on 98 if they run at all.\n\nThat being said OS9 is also dated.\n\nI would upgrade to something running Windows XP Pro or if you want to spend more and have fewer software options available Mac OSX. The upside to Mac being that you would be exposed to fewer viruses and have a flashy GUI.

3	how do I write a cover letter to help me get in as a flight attendant for the airlines................? One thing that is especially important in writing to the employer is knowing a little about the company so that you can logically tailor your words to the position and the organization. Do some research and share what you have learned in an engaging way. \n\nWhen your resume and cover letter first reach the prospective employer, the employer will start to form an opinion about you. How professional are you? Are you detail-oriented, ambitious, responsible and/or qualified for the job? \n\nWriting a good cover letter entails thought and time. Map out the information you want to place in each section, then go back through and fine tune it. Don’t try to write brilliantly from the salutation to the signature in the first draft. Revise it each time you go through it. \n\nMost of all show the employer why you are the best person for the job. Indicate how you will contribute immediately to current projects by emphasizing your qualifications and determination to succeed. Let the employer know that you aren’t just another applicant. You are the one to fill the position.
7	Does iTunes always take so long to download tv shows??? I'm trying to download some tv shows but it's taking soooooo long. Is it always this slow??? A whole TV show is a large file. A song might only take a minute or so, but a show is like 45 minutes of information to download. I haven't tried but I can imagine it might take a while to down load.\n\nMy neighbor downloads movies and even with DSL they take like 30 minues to come across.

1	Why are air bubbles spherical in shape? Why can't they be say cubical? IF an air bubble was cubical then it would have to spend an extra amount of energy to form that shape.\n\nSphere is the only shape which has the least surface area as compared to its volume. So the bubble does not have to waste energy in trying to stretch its surface area.

5	what is the difference between Indy Cars and Champ Cars? what has the most horse power and why? The engines that Champ Cars use produce about 850hp compared to the ones the IRL uses that produce about 650hp and are limited to 10,300 rpm.  After several high-profile accidents in 2003 (including ones involving Mario Andretti and Kenny Brack), the IRL made many changes to reduce speeds and increase safety.
0	What age do you think children should be able to stay home alone? What age should they no longer have a babysitter?  Example:coming home from school and spending 3-5 hours alone. It depends on the child, and your exact situation; but a safe bet would be a young teenager, 13-16. An extremely responsible child in a neighborhood with very little crime, I might say as young as 10. Then again, I know some kids who aren't responsible enough to be alone before they turn 14; and some neighborhoods I've lived in where I wouldn't let the best kid stay even then. My best advice is if you trust them to fix a healthy meal for themselves (especially since they'll be alone until between 6 & 9 PM) then you can probably trust them to be alone.
8	Can a guy be friends with a girl if their relationship was 'pretty much'  purely sexual? I've known this guy for several years and the relationship was primarily physical.  I've called it off several times but he always resurfaces saying he misses my friendship.  I know he is in a serious relationship, so should I believe that this time he really does want to be 'just friends'? No probably not.  He's probably not happy with his current relationship or its lacking in some way and he's searching for you to fill that gap.  He may not be wanting sex, but he's definitely interested in something selfish.  Otherwise he wouldn't be putting himself in such a bad situation to hurt his current girlfriend.  Besides, would you want to be friends with someone that had those kind of values?  I mean he does have a girlfriend, and now he's going to his ex to be friends?  pretty shady if you ask me.
0	What are you basically =) ? I know... funny question, but I mean by what are you is...\n\nare you Filipino-Chinese?\nJapanese-American?\nAmerican?\nItalian?\n\nJust thought I'd like to post this. Feel free to add which of your relatives were... you know. I'm from Argentina, and like many people here, I'm a mixture of different races. My dad is a descendant from Italians and Spanish people (that's the commonest here). But my mum has ancestors from as different countries as Lebanon, Syria (on her dad's side) and Switzerland (on her mum's side)!\n\nBut again, this is not so uncommon here. If you take a look at the surnames in the book directory, you wouldn't know where exactly you are.

1	Can Someone Explain What A Botanist Actually Does? i am looking into taking a botany major in college it seems very interesting to me...but i dont know what a botanist would do once graduated from college? i really dont wanna work for a nursery...i wanna research plants etc..etc.. I myself am a agriculture major with a Master's degree. I have a few friends who are in the field of Botany and Plant Pathology (it studies the diseases plants can get) Here are some materials for your thinking.\n\nIf you think you like to do research, going to grad school at least for Master's degree is necessary. As a Botany major, you can work as a researcher/research assistant. Schools like UC Davis, UC Riverside, Cornell, Purdue, Texas A&M,etc, have great research labs to work at. You can also work for USDA (Department of Agriculture). They have many many experimental stations in almost every state. At such environment you have more chance to work with local farmers or agro industry while doing research. Some people like this better than pure research in universities.\nBesides, you can also work as a plant breeder for private seed companies. Teaching at college level is also an option after you finish the grad school.(Be sure to work as a teaching asistance before you graduate. This gives you good experience-you get to teach while experienced professors are suprovising by your side)\n\nSince you have not decided your major, I would suggest you to work in a research lab in Botany or Horticulture, just to know what life is like working in this field. You'll know if it's for you soon after you work there. Good luck and have fun!
1	why does H2O boils under 100 Degree on mountains? The lower pressure in the mountains results in a lower boiling point.\n\nReason:\nAs there are fewer air particles occupying the space above the water, it becomes easier for the bubbles to reach the atmospheric pressure up there, burst and escape as water vapour.

9	A question for conservatives...? Here is the Wikipedia definition of Libralism:\n\nAn ideology, philosophical view, and political tradition which holds that liberty is the primary political value.[1] Broadly speaking, liberalism seeks a society characterized by freedom of thought for individuals, limitations on power, especially of government and religion, the rule of law, the free exchange of ideas, a market economy that supports relatively free private enterprise, and a transparent system of government in which the rights of minorities are guaranteed. In modern society, liberals favour a liberal democracy with open and fair elections, where all citizens have equal rights by law and an equal opportunity to succeed[2].\n\nThe US was founded on these principals, how does anyone in their right mind disagree with them? If you are a true American Patriot wouldn't  you consider yourself to have liberal core values? Therefore, generally considering yourself liberal? Do you even know? Let's see how many of you even answer... Sorry I'm a liberal but I just had to come take a peek...\n\nGOOD JOB!!! WELL DONE!!!!\n\nAs I read that definition, I thought to myself, 'OMG THAT'S ME'. And I really for good about being me today. :)

3	How do China and India survive in their economy despite of over population? India is too diverse to explain in a line. I'd say, population is not a problem now, its getting better now. The birth rates are declining, and by 2040, the population will stop expanding.\n\nEvery year, 40 million new people join the middle class leaving poverty. As the population is huge, its a huge market, and everyone gets to sell his product/services. And with the flow of foreign investment, its been a huge amount of new jobs being created. And the outsourcing is helping new software professionals trained in India. New agricultural equipment, with farmers getting richer and richer, are getting common, and agriculture is also doing well.\n\nIts not so sweet though, there is corruption, poverty, illiteracy, riots. But we all are determined to make a better India.
3	literature,fantasy and science:can all these be together in one person?can u tell me which to choose? im 13. i live in india.i am blessed (as they say) with a good power in languages. im a fan of J.R.R.Tolkien and also  very interested in Fantasy. but i like science as much! my interest in science is quite old.Please tell me which line to choose. the problem came when i got less marks in all these because i could not give adequate time to them. Please give a good suggestion to me. It is going to affect my life You know.... There's actually no need to choose. Each of those three things you're choosing from may be focused on at different times. Getting too engrossed in one slows your growth as a person. You have to be able to move between different ideals. It's what makes a well-rounded individual.\nTake me for example, I love all the same things as you. I'm also really into Tolkien, Dungeons and Dragons, and the like. Yet, I am quite well-attuned to the realm of science, as I am a registered nurse and nurse educator. I am also a lover of literature as it makes me retreat to a quiet place after indulging into the intricacies of both science and fantasy.\nTry it. Focus on each one in turn. But not on all at the same time. It's easier that way.

7	Metallic "One"/Johnny Got His Gun question? If anyone has seen the music video One by Metallica, what does the last part where it goes "keep the home fires burning" mean. two points--one u asked for--one u didnt\n\n1. keep the homefires burning means the people back at home (not on the warfront) have to keep going, keep a lamp in the window, keep their country okay for when the soldier comes home\n\n2. Johnny Got His Gun is a book (by Dalton Trumbo) and then a movie of the same name. It's about a badly wounded soldier who  is in a coma but is trying to discover how badly wounded he is. Both the book and movie are great, and I think Metallica uses part of the movie in their video(I havent seen it in a long time)

0	Have you ever heard God's Voice? I do beleive in God and i do beleive\nhe can literally Speak to you.\nBut has he ever spoken to you? I have heard Him many times. Never the audible voice, but no doubt it was God. Just one quick example. About ten years ago I was driving down the road. There was a fairly large cardboard box in the middle of the road. Now I like a little sport and I admit I have lead in my shoes, so I thought," Gonna bust that box wide open." I distinctly heard a voice say ,"NO!" so I served to miss it. I looked in my rear view mirror and watched a toddler crawl out of the box. I locked my car up and pulled over. Walked him into the fenced yard he came from, locked the gate. I was trembling. Couldn't thank God enough.

2	Help! Does fruits make one fat? I am watching y weight and one of the advice that I got is 2 eat 5-6 times a day which consists mainly of fruits and vegetables. But I discovered that I am adding weight instead of loosing it and my boyfriend said its because of the fruits (i.e. the fruits are making me fat), but I only take 2 oranges and 1 apple a day. Are they (oranges and apple) responsible for my weight gain? Help! Hi Cleopatra!\n\nFruit and veggies don't cause weight gain, eating more calories then  you burn does.  Thus, I suggest you keep to the 5 meals per day, but keep your total calorie intake to 1500.  Then stay active: dance, shop, walk, play, etc.  Simple rule, fruit has more calories than veggies, so error on that side.\n\nThe should get you started where you could start to see progress within the week if you stick to it.\n\nI believe this answers your question, but if not, you can shoot me an email at: gregg@leandownsite.com\n\nGood luck on your diet and fitness goals!\n\nTrainer Gregg\nYou can achieve anything you set your mind on

4	with an add on card ATM system wat would happen if both the persons withdraw money from diff places simultaneo i've an account for which i and my father hold ATM cards. Now i'm at Delhi n my dad at Pune and the balnce in the account is Rs.10000. Both of us r trying to withdraw money from the account at 9:00 in the morning exactly. Another problem is i'm tryin to withdraw Rs.8000 and my dad an amount of Rs.5000 which exceeds the balance of Rs.10000. So, wat would happen in such a situation and how could we technically term it??? No,the people who design banking systems have thought of that one...  When you use an ATM, you are not directly accessing your bank account, you are simply placing a request for a transaction.\n\nTransaction requests are placed in a queue and only one will be processed at a time, for a particular account.\n\nEven though both requests are placed at the same time, they will be assigned different transaction numbers, and one will be picked for processing first... usually the one that gets to the queue first.\n\nAccess to the account would be locked for a short period until the first transaction is completed, so the second transaction would be held in queue.\n \nOnce the first transaction is completed, the lock will be released and the second transaction will be processed -  in this case, unsuccessfully.\n\nTechnically, this is called "conflict avoidance"
9	What did the Illegal Immigrants have to gain by taking 5/1/06 off? Did they just want to be fired?  Did they just want to tick everyone off, or did they just want to let the government know that they were illegal and they were almost ready to be deported all the way back to the homelands?  You never know, what do you think they were trying to gain? You obviously missed the point of the protest. I would suggest you switch from Fox to another newcast.\n\nIt is to symbolize the affect that illegal immigrants and their supporters have on the economy.\n\nIt's so you can ask yourself what do you have to lose by kicking them out? The issue is not to open the border, because I know how much your racist rhetoric would hate to have spanish people sharing the same public fountain as you. It's about granting rights to those who are already contributing to the economy.\n\nBut I'm sure you'll chose as a best answer whoever eggs on your racism.
6	Real Estate? What does ARM mean and how does it affect the cost of buying a house? This is a mortgage question.\n\nAn ARM refers to your loan term and is defined as ADJSUTABLE RATE MORTGAGE. It indicates that the loan's rate is not fixed and can change. the rate art which it changes depends on the type of loan. Some have short term fixed periods and then convert to adjustable. \n\nThere is a right and a wrong time for these. As a general rule, these are for short term options...5 years or less. Meaning, if you think you will move or want to refinance, or could have a better credit position in less than 5 years...then an ARM makes sense.\n\nI write a blog on the subject of credit management, mortgages, real estate trends, etc. Check it out for more information that may be helpful.

Guilds were\n\nexclusive, regimented organizations; \ncreated in part to preserve the rights and privileges of their members; and \nseparate and distinct from the civic governments, but since the functions and purposes of guild and civic government overlapped, it was not always easy to tell them apart, especially since many well-to-do guildsmen were prominent in civic government. \nTwo kinds of guilds were especially important to civic life--merchant guilds and craft guilds. \n\nMerchant Guilds\n\nThe merchant guilds were probably the first to appear and constituted the nucleus for civic organization. \n\nAs early as the 10th c. merchants formed organizations for mutual protection of their horses, wagons, and goods when travelling. \nOften a merchant guild would found a town by obtaining a charter. \nCraft Guilds\n\nThe craft guilds came about by increased specialization of industry. \n\nA group of artisans engaged in the same occupation, e.g., bakers, cobblers, stone masons, carpenters, etc. would associate themselves together for protection and mutual aid. \nAs these craft associations became more important than the older merchant guilds, their leaders began to demand a share in civic leadership. \nSoon no one within a town could practice a craft without belonging to the appropriate guild associations. \nThe purpose of the guilds was to maintain a monopoly of a particular craft especially against outsiders. For example, the harness makers would get together and figure out what the owners of business needed from that trade then allow as many masters to set up shop as the business could support. \nConsumer and Worker Protection\n\nIn protecting its own members, the guilds protected the consumer as well.\n\nMany craft regulations prevented poor workmanship. Each article had to be examined by a board of the guild and stamped as approved. \nBecause of lack of artificial light, work at night was prohibited. \nIn Florence the number of dyers was specified by the guild. In one place it was forbidden to see pigs fattened by a barber-surgeon lest the pig had been fattened on rich peoples' blood. \nMetalware plating was tantamount to fraud and, therefore, was forbidden. \nTo regulate competition between members the guild forbade advertising. \nAll prices were regulated \nCraftsmen could take work outside where it could be seen. \nPrice-cutting was strictly forbidden. \nTo preserve its monopoly a guild forbade the sale of foreign artisans' work within a city. \nThe most important processes used in manufacturing were guarded. In Florence a worker who possessed any essential trade secrets and for some reason fled to a foreign territory must be tracked down and killed lest he divulge the information. \nMonopoly existed within individual guilds through the limitation of the number of masters. \nNo member was ever allowed to corner the market by purchasing a large supply of a product or commodity so as to be able to fix the price. \nServices Performed by Guilds\nGuilds performed other services for their members as well. They\n\nprovided funeral expenses for poorer members and aid to survivors; \nprovided dowries for poor girls; \ncovered members with a type of health insurance and provisions for care of the sick; \nbuilt chapels; \ndonated windows to local churches or cathedrals; \nfrequently helped in the actual construction of the churches; \nwatched over the morals of the members who indulged in gambling and usury; and \nwere important for their contribution to emergence of Western lay education. In earlier times, the only schools in existence had been the monastic or cathedral schools. \nGuilds and Community Interrelationships\n\nThe members of the guild were called confraternities, brothers helping one another. From the political viewpoint, the guild was neither sovereign nor unrelated to society outside the guild and town organization. As a collective un
3	name " danville "? does anyone know were the name for the town of " danville " come from in california and when was it first founded Danville was settled and named by Americans drawn here by the California Gold rush. Daniel and Andrew Inman bought 400 acres of Old Town Danville with their mining earnings in 1854, after living here for a summer two years earlier. By 1858, the community boasted a blacksmith, a hotel, a wheelwright and a general store and the townsfolk wanted a post office.\n\n"But what should the community be called?  In an article years later,  Dan Inman said "quite a number (of names) were suggested." He and Andrew rejected "Inmanville," finally settling on Danville. According to the modest Dan, the name was chosen as much or more out of respect for Andrew's mother-in-law who was born and raised near Danville, Kentucky. Of course it also recognized the energetic young Dan who was later an Alameda County Assemblyman and Supervisor."

9	Does A US Born Child have to be 21 for parents to be legal in the usa? parents are from canada.? Technically, children born in the U.S. whose parents are not citizens of the U.S. are not automatically U.S. Citizens (contrary to popular myth).  That being said, even if the child is a U.S. citizen the parents do not automatically become U.S. citizens.  They must go through the naturalization process like every other citizen-to-be must.\n\nThe 17th Amendment deals with the popular election of Senators, not U.S. Citizenship.  The 14th Amendmendment deals with citizenship, the due process of law, and the election of Representatives.\n\nI stand partially corrected, however.  There is currently an ongoing debate whether or not children of illegal immigrants born in the U.S. are automatically citizens.  Since the parents have not vowed to relinquished their loyalty to their home country they are not "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" of the U.S.  This will likely be heatedly debated for the next few years until the illegal immigration problem in this country is worked out.\n\nRegardless, the Canadian parents still need to go through the naturalization process...they cannot "automatically" become citizens.

2	I quit smoking 52 hours ago, yea I know it hasn't been that long, but I feel so sick. Very very very dizzy and I am yelling at people who won't stop smoking in front of me. I'm not sure what to do, I really want a cig. but I've heard that if you can make it 3 days you will be fine. Is this true? Is it normal for me to be so dizzy? and how come people are so rude??? it's like they have no respect for the fact that I want to quit, will I always want to smack someone who is smoking in front of me in the head? or you think I will get over this? Sorry this question sounds insane, I just need some reassurance that I will feel better, right? be honest.  how long do you think this will last? thanx Here's some tips.\nQuitting smoking is a great opportunity to learn about ourselves.\nCongratulate yourself  on having the desire to stop - then you are over the worst, but still need to maintain your resolve. It's just so easy to start thinking that just one won't hurt, but it does. Just one achieves nothing except feeling the need for another. Whatever you do, don't have just one. Beware - alcohol will weaken your resolve.\nHere's a few home-brewed tips that might be useful.\nIt's not just nicotine addiction - there are 50+ chemicals in cigarettes. Also the main problem is habit.\nWe have been used to having body sensations which we translate as 'my body needs something', which we have attempted to satisfy by having a cigarette.\nWhen we try to stop smoking, we still get these 'my body needs something' sensations, and we still feel that we want a cigarette. We have to train our body to be more selective. When we feel we need something, we have to work out what it is that we actually need.\nA glass of water is an excellent substitute if nothing else comes to mind, as it helps with the clearance of the toxic substances in our body. Another good substitute is a bag of salted peanuts, used in combination with the water.\nAnother thing to do is to find an activity which occupies the mind or body. Go swimming - nobody wants to smoke while they are swimming. Slowly, as our body adjusts and translates the 'want something' feelings into something other than cigarettes, then the feelings begin to go away. We know its not a cigarette that the body really needs, because as soon as we've had one we still have the feeling, and want another!\nWe will have a few bouts of feeling or even being short tempered. We must try to bite our lip, and control; ourselves. Recognise the short temper as being the removal of toxins which are trying to find a way out. They went in through the mouth, and they try to get out that way to. We must learn to keep our mouth closed, and force the toxins out the other way.\n\nAfter we have stopped for a while we will begin to feel that just one wont to any harm.\nAll that leads to is a desire for just another one. We must guard very strongly against the desire to have just one.

Some say we shouldn't punish soldiers who have committed crimes in Iraq, that it would hurt morale. \nThe President says the opposite.

If ... laws have been broken there will be punishment" Mr Bush said in Washington.\n\nMarine Commandant Says Marines in Iraq Know Right from Wrong.\nGeneral Michael Hagee said if an individual is found to have broken rules or regulations or regulations, " he will be held accountable regardless of grade or position.

1	what is the chemicle sprayed by the mosquito before it bites? How it causes transient local anaesthesia? Mosquito sprays some chemical from distance before biting so that the victim does not realize it. The effect of this chemical is only temporary. What is the nature and type of this chemical? I don't think they do use an anesthesia.  Especially not one from a distance.\n\nYou usually don't feel the bite because their bite because its such a small needle.

0	how do i get my crazy parents to stay out of my life and leave me alone? Well, you didnt give much info on your life and I will assume you live at home.  If you do still live at home, you will pretty much have to suck it up until you move out on your own.\n\nAfter about 6 months of "freedom" which means for most new renters/leasers that you are probably about one pay check from being in the streets or mooching off friends, you will probably understand why they were trying to keep you straight with some rules while you were at home.\n\nBasically, they are trying to see you live to be old enough to move out on your own and develop enough responsibility to maintain yourself without becoming a homeless bum when you finally do.
3	please translate this french word to english, "saussurianism "  its in a book about history of french lang ... I believe that refers to Ferdinand Saussure, the linguist who developed the theory of laryngeals in common Indo-European phonetics (ancestor to most European, north Indian, Iranian languages). It was a controversial theory for a long time, proposing a sound that no longer exists in any of the modern Indo-European languages. Saussurianism, I guess, is a school of thought on Indo-European phonology.
2	when your arm feel funny? my arm fell like shake and could not stop it Did you feel any cramping at all? Sometimes this can happen from cramping, otherwise Spasticity (muscle spasms) tends to affects larger areas of the body - arm, leg, trunk, neck.. Which is what it sounds like you had/have.\nHere is a little information on muscle spasms in this is the case. \nhttp://www.alsa-or.org/treatment/MuscleSpasms.htm\n\nAs for what Fuschiahedgehog said above\nThat is just absurd to say "Could be anything from a seizure to a stroke" who seems to think they are a doctor.\nRidiculous!\nHere are the signs of a stroke to better educate yourself... I can almost see "Seizure" because epilepsy causes muscle spasms/seizures which can cause an arm to shake out of control, but usually there are more signs of a seizure than just that:\nhttp://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4742\n\n\nAnyways, you are better off seeing a doctor other than reading what others have to say who have no medical background.\n\nEdit:\nFrom reading all of your questions I would strongly suggest you see a doctor right away... Fever and involuntary jerking/shaking can be a danger and something has to be causing it. If Insurance is a problem, there should be some form of clinic near you that can work with you.. Also an ER in a hospital can't turn you away and won't charge you on the spot.. usually they will work out some sort of payment plan as well.

2	What can cause a hole in facial bones near the sinuses? If you take too much psuedophed for your sniffles, your body will become dependent on the drug.

0	How come homeless people just don't get jobs? ok, big dog, how are they reasonably  going to do that?  They have no address, no reliable transportation, no real way to groom themselves or their clothing for interviews.  How many people would hire such a person?  Even if you were willing to do so, how would you contact them for an interview?  Think the dirty, rags-wearing, hobo bit is an act? they really drove to their corner in a Lexus and have a Razr cell phone in their pocket?  That is only the self-delusion nonsense of right-wing idealogues who say things like" they only do it cause they are lazy; wanna mooch off of us hard-working (read: White)citizens!"\nSure, a lot of homeless folks are there of their own accord- drugs, alcohol- bad choices- but a great percentage are mentally ill.  And if one decided to clean up, how could they?  Try it yourself...

0	I want a tattoo? What do you think? I am going to turn 18 and someone told me to do something that i will remember my eighteenth birthday so should i get a tattoo? do they hurt? what should i get? any ideas in mind? I need someone;s idea or if a tattoo isnt it then what should i do ? tattoos only hurt depending on where you get them, my recommendation to you is to get a small tattoo that can be easily consealed by clothing or is concealed by clothing if you are wearing a shirt and shorts. the reason being is that if at some point down the road you absolutely hate your tattoo then you can at least keep it covered, it wont affect your ablity to get a job (because it is covered) and if you dont use colors other than black and blue it can be removed easier. and as far as what to get, get something that says something about you, not something you might change your mind on later in life. for example my gf got a tattoo of autumn leaves on her ankle because her middle name is autumn, which isnt likely to change. so dont be getting tattoos of what is cool now, get something that is relatively timeless
9	Please tell me the ratio between republicans and Demo's? # repubs. and dems. In America.Whats the ratio?\nBack up your source if you want. id say its about 54-46 in favor of repubs.......as far as political parties goes.\n\nhowever...a lot of people who vote democrat actually have conservative values (rom my sight and experience)...which proves they dhave no idea what they are doing.\n\nthe conservative to liberal ratio is much higher...probably close to 2 to 1.

I can only say that my bets for the semi-finals are for Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Czech republic and maybe England.\n\nYour final 16, however, is too Euro-centric.  Only 3 non-European teams.  There's bound to be an upset somewhere.
5	Ballack vs Kaka who is the more influential player? I'd say Ballack is a better leader but Kaka is better at bribbling and passing on the ground..what do you people think?

4	which is better: sims 2 or the sims(PC)? Sims 2 by far.\n\nOne of the best things is a more intelligent AI.  Your sims now are more likely to take care of needs (sleep, food, bathroom) then they were in the old one, so it means less "babysitting".  And they are much more likely to go to work or school on their own.\n\nThat is just one of many things that make Sims 2 a lot better then the original.  Add to that things like community lots and I wonder why anybody would want to continue to play the original.

1	why the sky is blue? The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.\n\nHowever, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you.

6	How is Book Value per Share calculated for a corporation? How can a company with only $4.25 per share of net tangible assets have a book value of $12.30 ??? The remaining book value can be from intangible assets like goodwill, trademarks, copyrights, organization costs, non-compete agreements & others. Many of which could be worth considerably less than the carring value on the books. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging usually from 5 to 15 years.\n\nHope this helps.

4	I am trying to connect to a xml file using jsp. I need some code! Anyone can help me out here? Frank,\n\nI will assume you want to read an XML file avaialble at a URL (which can be file://...) and that you want to extract information from the XML file. I can recommend the dom4j library (http://www.dom4j.org/). With dom4j you can simply write:\n\nSAXReader reader = new SAXReader();\nDocument document = reader.read(url);\n\nYou then have a document object that represents your XML document. You can navigate that object using the Dom4j API.\n\nI hope this helps,\n\nAlex\n-- \nBlog (XML, Web apps, Open Source):\nhttp://www.orbeon.com/blog/
1	What effect do u think this has on the bird populations of the local ecosystem? Read this first! Some people place bird feeders in their yards. "It's safe to say that feeders are more important to the people who maintain them than to the birds that use them. For people, bird feeders are a great way to connect with nature and enjoy close-up views of some of nature's most colorful and agile creatures. For birds, feeders merely supplement their normal intake of food. Even birds that regularly visit feeders obtain only a small percentage of their overall diet from them. However, research on black-capped chickadees has shown that chances of surviving a harsh winter may be greater for birds that have access to feeders. It's likely that this is true for other birds as well."

6	where can i find real wholesale prices? ipods, tv, fragrances, perfume, psp, Your question is a very common one. Naturally everyone wants true wholesale pricing but the answer really depends on how much business potential you can offer to the wholesaler or distributor. You can only get wholesale pricing (legitimate) with a business license and/or Tax ID to show that you are a reseller. If they don't ask for the form(s), I can assure you they are not legitimate. You can find directories of wholesalers at your local library... they are a little too expensive to buiy on your own. Try to find some that will work with you as a small business but remember these places are bombarded with requests to buy products at wholesale pricing and they won't do it for a few of this and a couple of that. It's got to be a win-win situation for you and the wholesaler so sharpen your presentation and ask for a break to get your business running.

8	I need a place i can go to get married in Gilbert AZ. FOR FREE!!!? We were going to get married at the East Mesa Justice Court but the judge still hasnt called us back and we want to get married tomarrow. Does any one know somewhere we can get married for free on short notice in the gilbert area thats not religous. It's about a half-hour from Gilbert and not free, but almost. Lost Dutchman State Park, right in front of the Superstition Mountains, is $25 (I think) and available as long as it's not being used. Dunno about tomorrow, but should be good for a fairly short notice as long as you don't hit it Veteran's Day. Throw in a parking fee and you're good to go. 6109 N. Apache Trail; (480) 982-4485.\n\nWe were thinking of using it but ended up having too many guests -- sounds like you might just have a small group/couple of people.

If yo utake the spring off it will let the swith stay in the ;off position. you can also follow it back to the motor and take it off completly. you might have to take off the gas tank and the butterfly manifold. Try messing with the carb and the carb jets, you can get that little baby screamin!

1	Is there a connection between the phases of the moon and earthquakes or volcanos? Yes, there should be a weak connection between phases of the moon and earthquakes or volcanoes.  Both earthquakes and emerging volcanoes depend on growing stress within the earth.  The moon can raise tides both in the crust of the earth and the oceans, affecting weight of water over portions of the earth.  The moon tide can serve as the straw that breaks the camel's back causing an event to happen slightly sooner than it would anyway.  Of course phases of the moon deal with the reflection of the sun's light relative to the positions of the sun, moon and earth.  Because the ocean tides (and crustal tides) also depend on these same positions where the sun either works with or against the moon), the phase of the moon can slightly affect the weight of the straw that breaks the camel's back.
0	Aren't you trying to wriggle out of what the Bible clearly says about homosexuality? "What the Bible says about anything is selective, contradictory and liable to change in interpretation. People do not believe in " what the Bible says". People believe in traditions about what the Bible says. Judeo-Christian tradition certainly is homophobic but whether the words of Jesus are homophobic is another matter. The various Christian theological traditions are so different from one another that they cannot be identical with the words of Jesus. The believer must decide whether the words of Jesus are more important than Christian traditions. Arguing out of Christian traditions is circular." (Margaret Evans) Ok, here it is: The magority of guys aren't much for gay sex. So went thelogical documents are written or edited or translated (like the bible) the minorities get screwed over. Like women or gays. Personally, I really don't care what people do in their bedrooms and niether should other people. Oh, an MAINWORRY get a freakin' life and get your head out your rear. Jeez...
2	ok.. i work out a lot.. i mean i walk an hour a day.. every day in 30 degrees? weather.. and i aslo try to run on treadmill but it suks cuz im tryin to loose weight tone up for bikini season and well im always hungry.. I Mean i do eat.. n i drink tons of water.. i just dont know why im always hungry and im not sure its really annoying too Being active, especially running and jogging will be burning a lot of calories and in turn making you more hungry. This is just your bodies way of replesishing its resources, as long as you eat healthy meals and choose foods correctly then you will still be able to increase your metabolism and keep your weight down.
1	Is thunder the sound of lightning? Yes.  You see the lightning instantaneously, but, since sound travels more slowly than light, the sound of the thunder is delayed.  One fairly reliable way to tell how far away the lightning is is to count the seconds between when you see the lightning strike and when you hear the thunder.  Divide the number of seconds by five, and that is approximately how many miles away the strike was.
8	why does my best friend always try to make me jelous? It seems like every time she gets or does something new, she has to rub it in my face or make me feel like shes better than me for it. A true friend will never make you feel bad about your self and will never hurt you. You might want to rethink this friendship with this girl. She obviously doesn't sound like a true friend. And just because you have known someone all of your life doesn't make them your bestfriend. A bestfriend should be someone that lifts you up, and never let you fall down.

2	Has anyone ever..? heard of these symptoms:\n\n-fatigue..i sleep a lot, never feel refreshed, and am always tired throughout the day\n-constant infections, etc. such as colds or viruses.\n-increased bleeding tendency\n-cuts don't heal well\n-constant enlarged spleen\n\nive had mono before, and had it reoccur..but does anyone had any ideas as to what may be going on? could it be diet? allergies? Possibly anemia? A simple blood test can determine whether you have a low red blood cell count.  You might possibly try to include iron in your diet, but yes, like the other folks here, a doctor visit would be in order. There are other types of conditions which can contribute to these symptoms, such as chronic fatigue, increase stress, or simply malnutrition.

1	Log(x+1)=Log3-log(2x-1)? can someone explain to me how to solve this You can combine the right side terms using the\n property log(a/b) = log a - log b in reverse.\n\nIt is log(3/(2x-1))\n\nSo now you have log(x+1) = log(3/(2x-1)\n\nSince the logs are equal, so must be the things you took the log of.\nSo x+1 = 3/(2x-1)\n\nCross multiply: (x+1)(2x-1) = 3 \n\n2x^2 + x - 1 = 3\n\n2x^2 + x - 4 = 0\n\nSolve for x.  Check that when you plug it in, you don't end up with the log of a negative number.

(ie fossiliferous limestone; metamorphic may have some "warped" unidentifiable fossils but more than likely won't; it is impossible for ign. rocks to contain fossils b/c of complete melting of rock)
2	How come I don thave wet dreams? I something wrong with me? The nightly wet-dream just is a normal event and for young guys mainly.\nIn fact, during puberty and adolescence it is due to the hormones storm while later it just is the vivid fantasy and the hot dreams to let that event.\nIt occurs in the night and precisely at the end of the sleep and in the REM phase of the sleep.\nOn that time dream are more deep and unconscious, many erection occurs repetitively and during one of them, there could be a little ejaculation too. \nWhen awake guys remember nothing about.\nGrowing on and with a regular sexual life such occurrence decrease till to disappear.\nThere’s no problem of course. Maybe you too got them during the night (with no emission), and you don’t remember that, or, on the contrary, your fantasy isn’t so vivid or you libido is very soft.... \nOKAY??

Hook up the cassette player soundcard depending on which kinds of socket available for use ( RCA and the others).When you record the music it converts to digital format. Save it and burn.

8	my boyfriend is too shy to kiss me - could it be too soon for him? We are both 16. I have had a few serious relationships before, but he has never even had a girlfriend. He is sooooooooo shy. We've been dating for a month. He asked me out, but i have had to be the one to grab his hand, and hug him. Since he is so shy and innexperienced i am afraid of pushing him into anything, but i really want to kiss him. is it too soon? he probably wants to kiss you, but he's afraid because he doesn't know how. make sure he's in a good mood, try cuddling with him in the dark (being in the dark may make him feel more comfortable), ease him into it by getting close, softly rub the tip of your nose on his, then on his lips, then you can rub your lips on his, then kiss him. remember--do all of this slow and gentle (it will make hom feel more relaxed).\nGood Luck!!!

1	what is the relationship between ubiquitin protease system and huntington disease? genetics The main histopathological feature of Huntington's disease (HD) is the presence of protein aggregates that are gathered into inclusion bodies. So far the mechanisms that lead to inclusion formation as well as their role in the pathogenesis of HD are not totally understood. However, it is well established that inclusion bodies contain components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Accordingly, it has been postulated that impairment of this machinery can be one of the causes of this disorder. In this review, the authors summarize the state of current knowledge about this hypothesis.
6	I want to open an Indian restaurant - ideas?  Advice? I am an accomplished amateur chef with an MBA.  My thoughts are that I know business and can assess an industry.  There are no Indian restuarants in my town.  My town is small-ish; 100K people, a decent sized University, a small but growing ethnic food market.  So..is this folly to entertain?  Eveything I read about opening a restaurant says " hard work!  low pay!  really hard!".  Well, that sounds like my life already.  Why not have some fun too?  I would love to hear people's opinions.\nThanks!\nEl it depends where you want to open the restaurant ? will people love the food which u will be serving ? etc. etc .\n\nP.S. - call me for parternship :)

College is a privilege, not a right.
9	Why is Yahoo so bias towards President Bush? You mean Yahoo as a company or the community of people on Yahoo Answers?\n\nI wouldn't say any of the above have been bias to Mr. Bush. In fact, I've seen people voice all kinds of different opinions on his politics and on his person in Answers.\n\nAnd if some (or many even) of them are negative, this has little to do with Yahoo or being bias. It's about freedom of speech, how the politics affect those people, and lets not forget many of them do not live in the US, but in places like Europe, where Mr. Bush has a quite low popularity quotient.

0	Does anyone know how to get in touch with an indigent lost relative in Hawaii? I happen to have tried just a few weeks ago to find an indigent person in HI.  \n\nFirst off, if the indigent person gets state assistance, you can inquire with the state.  They can choose to or choose not to answer your questions. \n\nSecondly, you can contact the local police and see if the person you have has a record, and they can choose whether or not to give you information.\n\ncopsysop@ilhawaii.net\n\nthat's the local police in the Island of HI.  They looked up information for me and my person didn't have a record there, but they did tell me to try the local police on the other islands. \n\nHope that helps
3	What is it these days? Do they not teach spelling in English Class any more? I just can't get over how many people don't seem able to spell words correctly. Even allowing for all the folks for whom English is not their first language ( and by the way I think all of you who fit into this category are amazing because the only foreign languages I have learnt a little of are French and German, and a little Latin!) and of course typos which we all fall foul of, there are so many English speaking folks who just can't spell! A good example is the word tongue - I have seen this word spelled 'tounge' more times than I have seen it spelled tongue!! What do other people think of this? I realise that I am probably just being a stickler! Thee probe lime ice stew dents deep end an there spill chick or.  Oh Nurse!

6	Why is it that governments are against cigarett smoking but cant stop farmers from growing tabacco? Is there any other big use for tobacco other than smoking, or is the money from it far above the pride of our leaders? It's money. Money talks and money is power. people and governments do some strange things for money and power. As far as tabbacco is concerned I see no real benefit from it, in our every day lives. its a nasty and dirty habit that has taken many many lives.
0	I am addicted to sex... but I am safe is anything wrong with that? I think I am addicted to sex because I need it everyday. There are guys I meet just for sex and then I leave.. I don't want to talk I just want to take it then go when its over. They always want to meet for dinner and drinks and stuff and I don't care about that. Its a waste of time. I have a few guys for it because if I stick with just one they get exhausted, or annoyed with me wanting it so much.\nI am always safe.... but is anything wrong with it? Is there anyway to stop? Will I be like this forever? Huh.  Interesting query.  I would say that if you don't think there's anything wrong with being human, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  \nYou'll probably get tired eventually.\nHowever, even being "safe" is not always 100%.  Make sure you get tested regularly, and try your best to not have a different guy every night so you can backtrack just in case.\nAlso, remember that no one ever got an STD from masturbating, and there are quite a few products out there to keep it interesting.\nHave fun, and have a pleasant day.
8	Does Anyone like dating? dating sucks. cost too much.
6	they want to move to Australia but does anyone no how when they ant got enough money to buy a house or rent? well i no someone who wants to move to australlia but she has a 13mth old son and only about 3,000 english pounds so how can she move to australlia with a child and only 3,000pound anyone ever done it or no someone who did and how this is all done? cause she wants to start a new life in a different location. thanks . Well, as long as she can get a regular job here fairly quickly she should be fine. 3000 pound is about 7,500 Aus dollars which is enough to put a deposit on a rental house and pay the rent for a little while (depending on which city she moves to - e.g. Sydney is really expensive, Adelaide is pretty good and Hobart is quite cheap) and probably get a few essential items like a fridge, bed, chair... She might have to do it tough for a while but if she is prepared to work hard she could probably do it. It is going to be quite difficult with a baby though - child care can be very expensive here.

6	when naming a business,how do u find out if that name is already being used as to avoid being sued? When you start your business, you will have to get a business license from your state (if you are in the US).  They will tell you if that name is already being used.
3	How are these things pronounced? 1) "Juelz" as in Juelz Santana\n2) "gauchos" as in Rebekka wore gauchos today If Juelz is Spanish in its root (or any of the latin languages, for that matter), then it is most likely pronounced 'Hwells,' making the 'H' sound with the back of your tongue. J isn't exactly the English H, it's a little harder, but if you say it like an H, people will understand you.
3	how do I start a private school? You have two strands of activity to follow at the same time in order to start a private school.\n\nFirst strand:  Establishing the Business\n\nYou will need to write a business plan (outline of your services and fees, costs, growth plan, personnel plan, etc.) and, if you need starting capital, take it to a bank for a starter loan. Probably several banks.  If you already have your seed money, or are approved for your loan, you will need to apply to the state for a business license, register with the state and federal tax departments, and obtain approval from your local government for your business location/zoning. Your local Better Business Bureau can direct you to someone who can help you with all this.\n\n\nSecond strand: Obtaining a license to operate a private school from your state Department of Education, including obtaining accreditation.\n\nFor example, here's the information for New Mexico: http://www.ped.state.nm.us/alted/private_schools/index.html\n\n\nGood luck!
7	Recently discovered some old Loaded's from 93/94. Was amazed how much more creative and article led they were compared to today. Have these magazines gone too far down the teets and ass line. Aren't these magazines today just lists really. For me its a bit sad. Writers on these publications dont seem to exist anymore. I remember some great articles, and cover-stars like Kevin Keegan or Liam Gallagher rather than random Hollyoaks/pop-chart cleavage. The girls were always there, but there was so much more.

I am not making this up.  They can audit from 6 years back so keeping the last 7 is a good idea.  I now this because my niece is an accountant and I asked her.

8	Do Christians recognize as legitimate marriages performed by non-Christian clergy? Sure, it's before "G*d," but WHICH ONE? They do. Back in the day, they would not have, since the Church was the only place you were allowed to get married, but alas, those days have passed.\nAnyway, nowadays, no matter WHO marries you, as long as they are recognized by the STATE in which you get married, it's considered a legitimate marriage.\nAlthough I think you're asking more along the lines of would they recognize and accept it? Some would, since the person who performed the marriage has to be legally licensed to do so. Some would NOT because they were not married in the eyes of God. They, in my opinion, are wrong. When two people love each other, yes, they can make that love whole by getting married, but if it's not in the Christian church, it shouldn't be a big deal.
1	Atheisms? Isnt science really the religion that is belived? This may sound crazy, but if you are religious you must believe in a religion, but if you are atheistic you do not have to believe in science.  An atheist does not have to believe in anything.
9	The Red Pill? (Truth, nomatter how choking or painfull) or the Blue Pill?(Comfortable lies)? What do you prefer? The fact that your dad have made his money from drugs or the blisfullignorance and full enjoyment of his money? That you religion isn`t from heaven and was made up by some budding philosopher or scholar, or the believe that the higher being in your holly book will take care of you?The fact you are not half the man/woman you think you are or that your love partner adores youas much as he pretends to? If truth is bitter and falsehood tastes better, what might you chose and why? Definitely the red pill, it's better to deal with reality than stay a mindless drone.

3	Explain how land as a resource can be under utilised and misused.? I have asked the above question following the tough discussion we have in our group about under utilization and misusing of land if this words are the same or not. So i would like to know as i have asked so that my group friends be feed with variets of facts from different sources like you. Thank you I have a n 8 acre field it hes been fallow for the past 25 years. This is under use, but it is now full of wildlife, I now fee that it is being used by the wildlife.\nIf a group of Diddicoys/Tinkers were to move on uninvited  with their caravans and animals and leaving  mess and dumping rubbish, this would be misuse.

1	How do you factor out? x^3-4x+3x^2-12=0 Rearrange them to x^3 + 3x^2 -4x -12 = 0\n\nThen group the first 2 and the second 2\n\n(x^3+3x^2) + (-4x - 12) = 0\n\nFrom the first group, you can pull out x^2; from the second group, you can pull out -4\n\nx^2*(x+3) -4*(x+3) = 0\n\nNow you can pull out (x+3)\n\n(x+3)(x^2-4) = 0 --- now x^2 - 4 is a difference of squares, which are factored a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b) so you can factor x^2-4 even further\n\n(x+3)(x+4)(x-4)=0
9	Who is the next Super Power ? China - World's fastest growing economy, Huge Exports\nIndia - World's second fastest growing economy, huge FDI (Foreign Investment), leader in Information Technology\nRussia - Had the highest profit in trade last year, Biggest Petroleum Reserves.\n\nOr any other nation\nPlease provide a logical reasoning if you choose a different country that's not listed here To be a super power, a country needed to be very strong militarily, economically and in global values.\n\nThe People's Republic of China is often considered a rising major power due to its large and stable population, its rapidly growing economy, and its rapidly growing military spending and capabilities.\n\nSimilar to China, India has a population of over one billion, nuclear weapons, the world's 2nd largest land-force and 4th largest airforce, as well as a thriving economy (4th largest in PPP). India also enjoys the advantage of a large and well-educated English-speaking workforce. The biggest obstacle: India is still a "developing" country in many respects with poor infrastructure, a huge poor and under-educated lower class that has a tremendous gap with the middle and upper classes; widespread corruption, brain-drain, social and ethnic tensions as well as potential conflict with its neighbor and rival, Pakistan. Despite India's widespread poverty, the Indian middle class consists of approximately 200 million people and poverty levels have been falling consistently since the '90s, though in rural areas, where most Indians still live, there has been little improvement. Today, approximately 20% of India's population lives in absolute poverty. It is thought that India's democratic foundations ensure some kind of long term government stability.\n\nRussia still possesses some attributes of a world power, notably including the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons, inherited from the USSR. It also has the proven ability to conduct manned space travel. Perhaps most importantly, it is the geographically largest country of the world and has control over a variety of strategic raw materials. Russia still has a clear capacity for destructive force, which in light of the current delicate political situation is not calculable beyond the medium-term. As one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia also has notable political influence in the world. However, Russia's economy is generally thought to be unstable and less competitive on a global scale. The population has been shrinking since the fall of the Soviet Union and is predicted to fall even lower within the next 10 years, due to drastically shortened life expectancies since 1990 and falling birthrates. Life in what was one of the safest places in the world has become rife with danger and insecure for most people. Furthermore, Russia is unable to control Chechen separatism and terrorism that is threatening neighbouring areas in the south and could lead to the break up of the south of the country. Russia is also unable to prevent illegal Chinese immigration into Asian Russia which may cause the eventual loss of that mineral rich region. A major brain drain of Russia's vast coterie of high quality scientists and engineers, a legacy of its excellent Soviet era education system, is also occurring and undermining Russia's long term economic development. Out of control post Soviet corruption diverts vast sums of government resources away from valuable programs. Corruption is also endemic in its business sector.

8	How do you seduce a man? Assuming he is a heterosexual man\n(I ask for educational purposes only!) This is an odd question because every woman has her own way of approaching and seducing men. We each come into this as we grow and mature and gain confidence in ourselves.\n\nI for one am one confident female. I often give stares, and mysterious smiles and when he approaches I shoot him down before he knows what hits him. I'm blunt and brutal and many guys find me a challenge. I can hang with the boys, and I can sit and trade insults with the best of them. Many guys find me intriguing because I am both tomboy and girlie girl. They attempt ot pursue and I laugh them off. Before long he's working towards something he doesn't even know about. Thats how I meet him, grab his attention and once I turn on my charm I've won him. \n\nBut thats MY way, and its taken years to develop. I don't even know why I am how I am, but its the way I behave 24&#92;7 and it makes men flock to me.

4	why do muslims woman wear long dresses? muslims woman First and foremost, because Almighty God (Allah) commands them to do so.   \nIn the Qur'an, Allah tells the believers to "lower their gaze and be modest."  \nSpecifically, it says:  "Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that will make for greater purity for them; and Allah is well acquainted with all that they do. And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; and that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what must ordinarily appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their chests and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers..." [continuing list of family members and others in front of whom women are exempt from covering] (Qur'an 24:30-31)
9	Shouldn't it be let up to the buisness owners to allow smoking or not? Here in ohio we are voting to band smoking or to allow it in bars,bowling alleys,bingo halls ect.\n\nBut right now *as of 11pm* the issue to band it is passing.  Yes smoking is bad but it shouldn't be up to the government to take it away. whats next....saying how many beers you can have? How much a certain food you can have? Lottery you can buy? The smoking ban went into effect here in Colorado July 1.  You can no longer smoke in a bar, restaurant, or any business.  Friends of mine who are waitresses have seen a huge cut in their income--seems non-smokers don't tip nearly as well as smokers did.  Here in the small town I live in, three bars and two restaurants have gone out of business; the owners have said it is because of the smoking ban.\n\nAs a former smoker, it doesn't matter to me personally.  But, I don't like it any time we lose another little bit of freedom.  Before, it was up to the public to decide--if you don't like smoke, don't go to establishments that don't clean the air with equipment.  The cash register should be the way things like this are decided, not the government.
8	who is better at sex guys or girls ????????and does anyone have a wild and crazy story not just about sex ???? Haha....all this talk of girls being better in bed made me laugh.

9	How do I get a green card after marriage? Will we be put under a microscope? This is a legit marriage, if I have to live in Europe w/ him, I will, so no smartass answers please. After marriage you will need to file for Adjustment of Status (Form I-485) to receive your Permanent Resident status.\n\nAnd yes to some extent you will be put under a microscope.  Once your AOS application is processed, they will schedule an interview for you and your spouse.  You will be required to submit evidence of a continued and genuine marriage such as financial documents in both names, utility bills in both names, shared credit cards, pictures, letters, etc.  The USC will have to submit an Affidivat of Support (Form I-864) to show that the foreign spouse will be financially supported and not become a public charge.\n\nIt's really not as daunting as it sounds.  If the marriage is genuine, its not difficult at all to prove it.
1	why are bee's attracted to bright colored flowers instead of white flowers? Bees are actually most often attracted by the pattern that is created in the coloring of the flower.  The stronger the contrast between the center of the flower, and the outside of the flower, the easier it is for them to see that they should pay a visit.  You might notice, for example, that bees would be attracted to pansies that have white leaves, but have a purple center.\nAlso, bees are attracted to sweet smelling flowers.  One of the most common white flowers, daisies, are foul smelling, and use flies to pollenate, as opposed to bees.

But your parents were supposed to file with the social security office after your birth, or the hospital supplies the forms, the parents fill it out before the mom and baby leave the hospital and then the hospital files it with the Social Security Administration.\n\nIf you are not born here, but come legally, you are eligible for one and need to file paperwork with S.S.A.\n\nIf you are not here legally, you are not entitled to one.

9	did the mafia and cia really kill kennedy? I'm not saying that I know for sure who killed JFK, but here is something to think about. JFK' s dad was connected to organized crime during prohibition. He was a bootlegger. Now fast forward to when JFK was running for president. He reach out to his friend Frank Sinatra, who was friends with Sam Giancana (boss of the Chicago Outfit). Giancana "pulled" some strings and JFK got elected. After he was elected, Giancana figured JFK owned the mob a favor. JFK put his brother as Attorney General, and both of them went after the mob. \nNow fast forward again to the assination and the aftermath. Whether Oswald was just a fall guy or if he was one of the shooters (and yes I said one of the shooters, meaning more than one shooter), I don't know. But Giancana being boss of Chicago had ties to New Orleans boss Carlos Marcello, who had ties to Dallas, and I think you know where I am going with this. Jack Ruby was connected to the Dallas Family. He wasn't very important, but he still had ties.

3	I am a senior in high school and i would like to be a high school history teacher. Any advice? I love history because i believe in the fact that "those who do not learn from their history are doomed to repeat it." Well i guess in Hitler' s case it worked out that he didn't know enought about it and went into Russia in the middle of winter. Back to the subject. I would like some advice on how to be a good teacher and some of the things i should prepare for from the students. Obviously, go to college to be certified to teach history. You will also have to take classes in educational methods, i.e. how to teach. It would be good for you to volunteer with the age group you are interested in teaching while you are in college so you can determine if you really enjoy other people's children enough to spend hours with them every day. What I find most challenging about teaching is keeping myself from getting burnt out from everyone needing something from me all the time. You will need to remember that some students will love history, some will hate it, and most will tolerate it because it is required. You also should consider being certified in a second teaching area, because jobs teaching history are hard to come by. Often districts want teachers who can teach more than one class.
7	How to divide 17 camels equally? A man dies and bequeaths 17 camels to his 3 sons. To the first-born son, he gives 1/2. To the middle son, he gives 1/3. To the youngest, he gives 1/9. The sons are confused because it seems they may have to slaughter one of the camels in order to fulfill their father's wishes. However, a wise man arrives at the scene riding upon his own camel and solves the problem for the three sons. No camels needed to be slaughtered, and the father's wishes were fulfilled.  The wise man bid farewell as he rode away on his camel. How did the wise man resolve this dilemma? He added his own camel to initially make 18.\nThen 1/2=9, 1/3=6 and 1/9=2.\n\nAdd them up and you get 17. Then the wise man took his own camel away.\n\nI hope thats the answer-it seems to work with everyone left happy
3	How many jaguars are living today in the world? I need the answers today. It is estimated that there are now only around 15,000 jaguars left in the wild and conservation is centring on the establishment of protected ‘National Park’ areas which may serve to reduce the decline of the jaguars natural habitat. In Belize, the government, aided by the WWF, have set aside 150 square miles of rain forest in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Preserve, which currently provides a protected environment for around 200 jaguars, the largest concentration of the wild cats species in the world. The WWF are also providing aid to protect some of the remaining rain forests areas of South America, which provide a refuge for the majority of the remaining jaguar population\n\n\nWish you the best and I hope that this is helpful to you and your assignment!
9	Whcih one of these countries is very strong and advance in deffence and weapons,RUSSIA OR USA? Russia doenst even have close to the weaposn we have.

2	Help me PLEASE... bulemic? if your bulemic i realla want to talk 2 you sp PLEASE messang me or I'd love it if you'd add me on messenger my ID is, when_can_i_be_me@yahoo.com i was bulimic for eight years.started in school and i just didnt want to stop after that.its so easy eating chocolates and fatty food and throwing it all up after that.i loved the pleasure food gave me,but always rem it starts from the mind.its all up to you.i didnt take pro help but was disgusted i gained 20 pounds when i tried stopping.\ni am cured now,it wasnt diffcult getting back to normal.i believe if you want to you will.i exercise 4 times a week and never exeed 1400 calories. i m not skinny but healthy and prob stay this way for a bit.\noh i cheated last nite...ate endless bars of chocolates and a tub of ice cream....blamed it on depression.automatically threw some of it up....your body has a reflex action after some time.relax.we are all human.\n\nBulimia is often less about food, and more to do with deep psychological issues and profound feelings of lack of control. Binge/purge episodes can be severe, sometimes involving rapid and out of control feeding that can stop when the sufferers "are interrupted by another person or when their stomach hurts from over-extension. This cycle may be repeated several times a week or, in serious cases, several times a day.\n\nTreatment is most effective when it is implemented early on in the development of the disorder. Unfortunately, since this disorder is often easier to hide and less physically noticeable, diagnosis and treatment often come when the disorder has already become a static part of the patient’s life. Historically, those with bulimia were often hospitalized to end the pattern and then released as soon as the symptoms had been relieved. However, this is now infrequently used, as this only addresses the surface of the problem, and soon after discharge the symptoms would often reappear as severe, if not worse, than when they had originally been.\n\nThere are several residential treatment centers across the country, which offer long term support, counseling, and symptom interruption. The most popular form of treatment for the disorder involves some form of therapy, often times group psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy. Anorexics and bulimics typically go through the same types of treatments and are members of these same treatment groups. This is because anorexia and bulimia often go hand in hand, and it is not unlikely that one has at some point participated in both. Some refer to this as "symptom swapping". These forms of therapy address both the underlying issues which cause the patient to engage in these behaviors, as well as the actual food symptoms as well. In combination with therapy, many psychiatrists will prescribe anti-depressants or anti-psychotics

3	can u solve this math problem? please help? solve 2sinX=1-2cosX in the interval [ 0 , 2pi) please help! Working in degrees\n\nUse the equivalence sin(x) + cos(x) = sqrt(2) * sin(x + 45)\n\nYou have 2 * sin(x) = 1 - 2 * cos(x)\nRearrange and divide by 2: sin(x) + cos(x) = 1/2\nThen sqrt(2) * sin(x + 45) = (1/2)\nand thus sin(x + 45) = (1/2) / sqrt(2)\n\nAfter that it boils down to calculator bashing\n\n(1/2) / sqrt(2) = 0.3536\nx + 45 = 20.71 (degrees)\nx = 335.7 degrees\n\nI'll leave you to sort out whether there are other solutions.

9	should alcohol be banned from the U.S? give reasons why it should or shouldn't One reason it should not be banned is that banning something only makes people want it more, which would increase the "crime" rate.  \nAnother reason is that there are many, many responsible drinkers that should not have to give up their beer, wine, whatever because of a few idiots.

9	How does one recognize fascism? With the different degrees of capitalism, where is the line between all out fascism and life as we know it today in America? Fascism is militaristic and nationalistic. In a Fascist government, there are no elections. Any major threats to the Fascist party are expelled from the country, killed, or otherwise silenced.\n\nIf the President bans elections and has the Democrats shot, we're living in Fascism. Until them, we're still a Republic.

9	is becoming a Lawyer worth it ? Any Lawyers, if you could do it over, would you become a lawyer again ? Only pursue becoming a lawyer if you are doing it for the right reasons.  I think the "right" reasons differ for everyone, but I can tell you what I think the "wrong" reasons are:  money, prestige, and/or any reason not having to do with personal satisfaction and happiness.  \n\nI don't regret my legal education, but what I do is not glamorous, and it can be very difficult and stressful.  Just read an article about the incidence of substance abuse, mental illness, etc. in the lawyer population as opposed to the general population.  There are a lot of unhealthy, unhappy lawyers.\n\nIf you go for it, then make sure you have hobbies that you keep up with after practice.  Don't let practice swallow you whole.  Also, despite the prevailing view that firm practice is the ONLY practice, make sure you consider what are currently considered "alternative" forms of practice that may suit you.\n\nI'm finally in what many would consider an alternative form of practice, and I still have difficulties and stress, but I'm much, much happier and actually enjoy practice now.  Do what makes you feel like a real person (cause firm life can make you feel like a soulless drone).\n\nGood luck.

I am a democrat, I live in Texas so I have to deal with a helluva lot of dumba$$ repubs at work. I can tell you from experience that most if not all republicans would in fact vote for anyone who fed them the kind of crap they need to hear about "smokin out terrr'st's" and all that ridiculous stuff. They have no morals and no minds of their own. And uh... as far as I am concerned they already voted for satan when they voted for Dick!

1	How does catalytic decomposition of sulphur compounds work? I distil my own vodka, using a still which is available commercially.   Various sulphur compounds give the spirit an off taste, rather like the smell of cabbage cooking, and they must be removed.   Until now I've done this with charcoal, but I've just bought a copper catalytic converter which you insert in the outflow of the still.   It's a tangle of thin copper wire like a copper scouring pad.   You're instructed to clean it with water and white vinegar before each use.   What is the chemical reaction that decomposes the sulphur compounds?   What temperature range is needed?   Could you get the same result by placing the converter in a bottle of the spirit instead of the vapour coming from the still?   Traditional pot stills for making whisky and brandy are made of copper. A couple of links\n\nhttp://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2005/techprogram/P18146.HTM\n\nhttp://www.freepatentsonline.com/4544461.html\n\nI believe your system is not catalytic and is just the reaction of the copper with hydrogen sulfide to get copper sulfide which you then wash off.

6	why do some company's charge sales tax and some don't? If you have the source to your information please list it. It depends on the state you live in and what is a taxable item in that state.\n\nFor instance, New Hampshire has no sales tax, so nothing is taxed.  In Massachusetts, there is a 5% tax on everything but clothing and food.\n\nIn Tennessee, there is a 7% sales tax on almost everything (food is a 6% tax) because the state doesn't take an income tax, so they make it back in sales tax.\n\nMost times, if you are shipping something you have bought online, they will apply your states sales tax once you fill in the information about yourself.\n\nSome places also don't have to pay a sales tax.  A non-profit organization (charity, schools, etc) will have a certificate to prove their tax-exempt status for most items.  If they have an event to raise money, they don't have to pay sales tax for the location or food, however, alcohol is always taxable if the state applies it.\n\nYou can check out individual sites for states to see which states have which taxes in more detail, but here is a summary of the states and their sales taxes:\nhttp://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/sales.html

8	My best friend of Seven Years Just stopped talking to me? We have been close friends talked about everything and anything. We both were single moms hanging out taking our kids every where together they were extremely close. Then she decided to hook me up with her brother so were dating and all hanging out and then she started saying things like I dont think he wants me and the kids around, I tried to tell her it wasnt like that. Now we haven't talked in months. I asked her brother to take care of this because I feel like it wasnt me what should I do? any suggestions Try talking to her and finding out the real reason she hasn't been hanging around.  You're right, it probably has nothing to do with you.  It sounds like she's jealous of the time that you and her brother spend together and feels left out.  Try to include her more and set aside special time for you and her.  So many people neglect their friends for a relationship and it should never be like that.  She may be jealous that you found someone and she's still single.  The only way to find out is to talk to her and keep trying to talk to her.  If your kids are close and you and her brother have a future you're going to be in her life for awhile, whether she likes it or not and hopefully you can find a way to peacefully co-exist.
8	is he just playin games with me or does he really like me? this guy in my class stares at me..!i dunno if he likes me or not..!if i come in the room wit my hood up he puts it up to..!and when im lookin at the board i see him glance at me for like a couple seconds..if he does like me should i ask him out?.i think hes kinda cute..and i dunno how to talk to boiiz i get shy and nervous around them..! Make sure there ain't no game playin.  Ask around, make sure he isnt with someone else.  Find out if he's a nice guy.  Don't have to be obvious about it, but you do need to protect yourself, I don't think you want a broken heart if he's playin you.  Be careful, but have fun too.  If he likes you..go out, get to know him first, before you open up to him too much.
7	Which do U think is better,, Helena or Welcome to the Balck Parade? Hmmm, hard choice.  I like them both.  Helena (to me) is darker and I prefer it when my mood is dark.  Black Parade is about death but kind of upbeat.  I guess I am going to have to hide behind my indecisiveness!
6	Can I give avoid taxes when I give a large sum of money by opening up a joint bank account in both our names? In excess of $50K... This will still be seen as a gift.  There is an annual exclusion of $11,000 for gifts made to each person.  There is also a lifetime exclusion of $1.5 Million.  So the gift would not be taxable, but you would be using up part of that lifetime exclusion and any future gifts or your estate may be taxable (estate and gift taxes use the same exclusion).

I know - so much to choose from, Jeptha sacrificing the first person who walks through the door so he could win a battle,and it turns out to be his daughter,who then asks dad time off so she can lose her virginity first... the eating of sh*t cakes, God telling Abraham to sacrifice his son then saying 'nayah only testing!!!'...the slaughters of Leviticus, but what is your actual most crazy, crude bit that illustrates best that yahweh(also used as  a placeholder name for 'the Lord'), could not possibly be the Loving and Forgiving God of creation that knows not hatred or vengeance? Even you can contribue, Mainworry, you lonely old sod. Hey Dumpfinds. Seeing as how you have such love and respect for a vengeful and jealous god, you will love this one:\n\n So tell them, "The LORD, the God of Israel, says: All your wineskins will be full of wine."  And they will reply, "Of course, you don't need to tell us how prosperous we will be!"  Then tell them, "No, this is what the LORD means: I will make everyone in this land so confused that they will seem drunk – from the king sitting on David's throne and from the priests and the prophets, right on down to the common people.  I will smash them one against the other, even parents against children, says the LORD.  I will not let my pity or mercy or compassion keep me from destroying them."   (Jeremiah 13:12-14 NLT)\n\nGotta love a god with attitude!

You are seeking help and that is a great first step, if it isn't for you then get your friend the help he/she needs before they get too far down that long dark alley.

5	$40 000 per match!!! Do you agree for that amount of money, referee's should be held more accountable? For that much money I think the players and fans are entitled to better performances from referee's than has been produced on the whole so far. Your thoughts? Ur  automatically  right.  They  have  cost  so  many  teams.  so  many  handballs  on  eighteen,miss using  red cards  and  yellow  cards,finding  more  fouls  in  a  team  than  the  other.  sometimes,  its  like  they favor  other  teams in  expense  of  the  other. this  really makes  me  sick. \n         they(the  stupid  referees ) should  be  paid  according  to  the  accuracy  of  the  game. this  will  make  them more  attentive  and  fair. I  know  they  are  human, but  some  go  away  too  far. whats  the  stuff  on  their  ears.isn't  it  a  communication  device. who  do  they  damn talk  to  and  why  are the  mistakes  increasing  after  every  game.\n           fifa  should  evolve  soccer  refereeing  like  other  sports.i  mean use  the  current  technology.

5	when was the first Ohio state Michigan football game where and what year????? The Ohio State University/University of Michigan rivalry in football began with their first game in 1897.  UM won that game 34 to 0 and dominated the series until 1919.  That year the tables were turned and the Buckeyes won 13 to 3.  \n\nThe Ohio State/Michigan game has always been important, but it was not always the last game of the season.  This practice began in 1935 and, except for one year, the tradition has continued.  Often the game has determined who is the winner of the Big Ten and who will represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.  An ESPN poll rated the rivalry as the greatest of all time.  \n\n“Ohio State/Michigan Week” has grown beyond the football game to include the annual blood battle, which benefits the Red Cross, food collection for food banks, and spirit events such as banner contests.  OSU and UM have turned the rivalry into an event that helps people across school lines.\nGreat website ive been there alot Michiagan has dominated that rivalry.  But im Not so sure they will keep it up this year.

1	frequency of a wave? A guitar string vibrates with the lowest possible frequency called the fundamental frequency. If the string has the length L0 = 65 cm, and the speed of a wave on the string is v = 368 m/s, then what is the frequency f of the wave on the string? When the string vibrates at its fundamental frequency, the wavelength is twice as long as the length of the string, since the only nodes are at the ends of the string.\nThen, by frequency x wavelength = velocity, the fundamental frequency is (36800 cm/s)/(130 cm)=283.1 Hz

6	I want to know what a gap analysis is? The definition appears to be industry-specific.  Here are two definitions, with appropriate links:\n\nIn information technology, gap analysis is the study of the differences between two different information systems or applications, often for the purpose of determining how to get from one state to a new state. A gap is sometimes spoken of as "the space between where we are and where we want to be." Gap analysis is undertaken as a means of bridging that space. Among the various methodologies used to perform gap analysis is IDEF, a group of methods used to create a model of a system, analyze the model, create a model of a desired version of the system, and to aid in the transition from one to the other.\n\nor:\n\nGap Analysis is a scientific means for assessing to what extent native animal and plant species are being protected. It can be done at a state, local, regional, or national level.

6	what is the difference between brand name and trade mark? A Brand Name is simply the name of a company, product, service, or combination of these. (e.g. Coke, Chevrolet, IBM, Jelly Belly, etc.) If you want to get technical, you can also have "Sub-brands" like Cherry Coke, Diet Coke, etc.\n\nA TradeMark is something entirely different. It's simply a legally protected word or phrase, used to "protect" that word or phrase. Typically protection only applies within a specific business category (e.g. beverages) and within a specific country. The protection prevents others in the industry from using the same phrase. Examples of things that may bear a trademark are brand names, taglines ("The choice of a new generation"), or the names of sub-brands or specific services: "McGriddle". It's also possible to trademark sounds (the ABC tones, the sound of a Harley Davidson engine) and logos (but sometimes with limited success - Harley Davidson was not successful. - the sound was deemed too generic and therefore "not ownable".)\n\nDon't confuse TM with Copyright - A copyright is obtained by registering an entire text, song, or other full proprietary creation like a book, article, lyrics, etc.

9	USA is believe to be a xtian nation.Why is she so free that she allows other religion to polute her?James NIge Many arab nations and some Countries like China highly restrict Christians in their country. For example,here in Nigeria, you are mosly like to get Saudi Arabians VISA in Saudis embassy if you are a Moslem than to be a christian. But in USA embassy the border is open equally to everyone. Christians in Africa are suffering for their believe more than other religion. Interesting thought,  The US was settled by people trying to get to a place where they could have religious freedom.  We have send many of our men and women to die to fight for others freedoms.  Would it not be hypocritical to say your free to be religious as long as it is the same as mine.\nAs far as being poluted by other religions, we welcome the diversity.  That is what makes America great.  Where people from all walks of life can have a equal say as to there spititual lifes.\n\nOne thing I would be looking at is how the countries are doing in the long run when they exclude people based on religion.  China is just now getting into the Industrial age after being backwards for the past 60 years under comunist rule.  Saudi Arabia is only going to last until the oil runs out, and even now the Saudies can't even wipe their own butts because they have been so dependent on outside talent.\n\nThe overwhelming thought in America is that you have the right to be free and to be seen as equal, no matter who you pray to.

8	What is the best way to get over a fiance's questionable past? I know it is stupid to let such a thing bother me, but sometimes it's hard.

But don't get married 'til you're sure you are over it!

0	What would you prefer? Being a successful athlete or a successful businessman? ATHLETE: You get rich around age 20, which means you are young and rich but by age 30 you would already have finished the prime of your career. over 40 you are a have been but in those 10 years you would make a lot of money and being young, fame and attention.\n\nBusinessman: You're a nobody at 20, probably still living with your parents. But by age 30 you start making money. you reach your prime between 40 -50, probably making much more money than an athlete and much more power although not much fame. But your youth was not all fame and wealth but building a base for your future.\n\nWhich scenarios would you prefer? Well, your question is a bit ambiguous, kind of a catch 22.\n\nIn my case, I would prefer to be the athlete.  I would get lots of money, up-front.  During my athletic career, I would invest it as I would if I were a business man.\n\nOnce my career was finished I'd have a LOT more capital to use and can then approach my new business with more choices.  Keep in mind that part of being a successful businessman is in your ability to attract people, and certainly athletes are among the most popular of people.  Therefore, when they are done with their career, have a good portion of their income available for business, I would have to say I MUCH prefer being an athlete first!

Common causes for abdominal bloating are:\n\nOvereating (gastric distension) \nLactose intolerance, fructose intolerance and other food intolerances \nFood allergy \nAerophagia (air swallowing, a nervous habit) \nAlvarez' syndrome, hysterical or neurotic abdominal bloating without excess of gas in the digestive tract \nIrritable bowel syndrome \nPartial bowel obstruction \nGastric dumping syndrome or rapid gastric emptying \nThe ingestion of some gas-producing foods \nConstipation \nSplenic-flexure syndrome \nMenstruation, dysmenorrhea and premenstrual stress syndrome \nPolycystic ovary syndrome and ovarian cysts \nMassive infestation with intestinal parasites, such as worms (e.g, Ascaris lumbricoides) \nDiverticulosis \nImportant but uncommon causes of abdominal bloating include large intra-abdominal tumors, such as those arising from ovarian, liver, uterus and stomach cancer; and megacolon, an abnormal dilation of the colon, due to some diseases, such as Chagas disease, a parasitic infection.\n\nGaseous bloating may be a consequence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures, due to the artificial mouth-to-mouth insuflation of air.\n\nPostmortem bloating occurs in cadavers, due to the formation of gases by bacterial action and putrefaction of the internal tissues of the abdomen and the inside of the intestines.\n\nIn some animals, like cats, dogs and cattle, gastric dilatation-volvulus, or bloat also occurs when gas is trapped inside the stomach and a gastric torsion or volvulus prevents it from escaping.

1	Please Help Me to Solve This True and False Questions!? Please explain to me whether the statement below are true or false:\n1. If F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), then y = F(x) is a solution to the\ndifferential equation dy/dx = f(x).\n2. If y =F(x) is a solution to the differential equation dy/dx = f(x),\nthen F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x)\n3. If an object has constant nonzero acceleration, then the position\nof the object as a function of time is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nI need the explanation too not only just the true or false answers.\n\nThanks for all the help! 1. This is true by Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\nLet f be a continuous real function defined on a closed interval [a,b]. F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x) means that F(x) = Integrate f(t) dt from a to x. Suppose there is x and x+h inside [a,b], we have F(x) = Integrate f(t) dt from a to x AND F(x+h) = Integrate f(t) dt from a to x+h. The definition for dy/dx is such a limit on \n[F(x+h)-F(x)]/h in which h tends to zero. F(x+h)-F(x)= "Integrate f(t) dt from a to x+h" MINUS "Integrate f(t) dt from a to x" which is EQUAL TO "Integrate f(t) dt from x to x+h" According to mean value theorem, since f is continuos so is F, there exist a value c between [x,x+h] such that "Integrate f(t) dt from x to x+h" EQUALS "f(c) h". Then [F(x+h)-F(x)]/h = f(c) h/h = f(c). When u tends h to zero, since c is squeezed between [x,x+h], c tends to x (sandwich theorem). Hence dy/dx = f(x).\nTherefore, from y=F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), you arrive at a conclusion dy/dx=f(x) which is equivalent to your question 1.\n\n2. This is also true by Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.(In fact this is a corollary(small truth following from the truth of a theorem, informally means small theorem)\n\nIf f(x) = F' (x) (ie dF(x)/dx). Therefore we know that limit h->0 for {[F(x+h)-F(x)]/h} is f(x). By mean value theorem, F'(c) = [F(x+h)-F(x)]/h for c in between [x,x+h]. {We assumed continuos function again, if not it doesnt work. In fact all your question means continuos function which is differential at all points within the function interval that we are interested in.} From f(x)= F'(x) we get f(c)=F'(c). Then you have F(x+h) = f(c)Xh + F(x). Since F(x+h) = f(c) h + F(x) for h tends to zero. Lets say we know that a certain initial value F(a). We want to find F(t) in the interval [a,x], then we can first start with F(a+h)=f(c) h + F(x) where c is between [a,a+h] and continue up till x. If we want to find F(x), it is just summation f(t) delta t, and if we limit delta x to zero, we get F(x) = Integrate f(t) dt from a to x  PLUS F(a), which is the antiderivative of f(x).\n\n3. x'' = k for k constant. Then x' = kt + C. x= k/2 * t^2 + Ct + D. Just do direct integration using statement 2.

Why no one programming language can do all the job?\nWhy there are thousands of programing language around?\nis it possible to create one programing language that is easy to learn? will it be possible to combine that thousands of programing language into one language? Programming languages are based on demand. As there are many options and fields for development each programming language works on a set of profile. Some are made to do very few jobs (as PERL and shell scripts) while some caters for a bunch of jobs (like java, VB). \n\nAs the demand is very varying and it is also based on domain (Windows, MAC or unix) there are many programming languages. The designer and developing organization consider all aspects before deciding which language they will use. \n\nAs the world is changing the demand and way languages works also changes. Although there is always more that one option to chose from. Most companies choose languages on the basis of - \n1. best in the breed\n2. Available resources \n3. Knowledge of programmers \n4. Less complexity \n5. Cost of language tools\n6. Future advancement options\n7. Compatibility with hardwares \n\nAll languages keep comming with new versions making thier own versions rival in the competetion like VB 6 and VB.net and the new VB 8.

3	How are learning disabilities, menatal retardation, and emotional disabilities the same/different? They are all the same in that the cause challenges to the natural learning process.\n\nThe difference is HOW they cause those challenges:\n\nLearning disabilities involve how a person processes their sensory information, their memory retrieval, and applies pattern recognition. A person with LD usually has average or higher intelligence, and there's a difference in brain wiring that interferes with academic learning. LD people do tend to have something else that they are very good at (art, sports, drama, music, etc.).\n\nMental Retardation means the person does not learn very quickly, and can only handle small chunks of information at any one time. A person with MR needs skills broken down into smaller steps, and each step repeated many times, in order to learn it.\n\nEmotional/Behavioral Disabilities means the person has neurochemical imbalances in their brain causing long-term anxiety, depression, hallucinations, obsessive/compulsive behaviors, etc. Most people take for granted that you act the way you feel, because most people only feel anxious, depressed, etc. for a reason (something has happened to cause the feeling). Most people generally FEEL happy, friendly, positive, motivated, etc. However, someone with an E/BD is punished for acting they way they feel, socially, because the anxiety, depression, or whatever is severe and constant. There is usually no obvious environmental trigger for it (e.g. a family member died, there's a major presentation due, or whatever). And no, they can't "snap out of it." Their body/central nervous system is doing it to them. \nWith a mood disorder, doing school work is very difficult because it is hard to concentrate when you're not feeling content, happy, motivated, etc. A person with E/BD can be externalized (posing a violent risk to him/herself and others due to showing the mood issues externally), or internallized (getting "eaten up" inside by the pain of the mood disorder and "shutting down"). Either way, learning won't be taking place effectively.
3	Where was pope gregory III pope at? Saint Gregory III, pope (731-741), a Syrian by birth, succeeded Gregory II in March 731. His pontificate, like that of his predecessor, was disturbed by the iconoclastic controversy in the Byzantine Empire, in which he vainly invoked the intervention of Charles Martel. Also during his reign he conferred the pallium on Saint Boniface in Germany, Willibald in Bohemia, and Bede in England carried on their most successful missionary labours. He died on November 29, 741.\n\nElected by popular acclamation, he was the last pope to seek the Byzantine exarch's mandate.

1	How long does it take our solar system,to make one revolution around Our Black hole? B.C.  Calenders Sagittarius A* was determined to be the center of the Milky Way, about 26,000 light years from our Solar System. We know the center is a Black Hole from observations of nearby suns in very fast orbits around it, showing high gravitational attraction. In 1999, knowing that Sagittarius A* was the center of the Milky Way Galaxy allowed astronomer Mark Reid and associates at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics to calculate that our Solar System takes approximately 226 million years to revolve around the Galactic Center.
8	Feelings about spouse prior to divorve and how you feel about it now? I am considering divorcing my wife. We have had problems for years and are in counselling for the second time. I dont feel for her the way she does for me. I am still unhappy and feel emotionally isolated in our relationship. The therapist pin pointed that we never connected emotionally ad were activity partners. I don't hate her and it bothers me to see her upset/cry. Sometimes we can even have a nice moment together on a friendly level.\n\nI'd like to hear from other who have been through divorce and how they felt about thier exs before and how they feel now. I felt exactly as you do prior to leaving my husband.  I cared for him, but was not deep in love with him any longer due to the trouble in our marriage for such a long time that didn't seem to be changing.  He resented me terribly for leaving and then just continues to try to punish me through the kids.  But I've never been happier outside of the deceitful, devious things my ex does, to be apart from him.  I have dated since my marriage ended and am not dating currently and again I have never been happier.  My point... that you don't have to be with someone to be happy.  I understand how you feel when you say it bothers you to see her cry, but if you are not going to be able to reciprocate the love she has for you, better to let her go and find someone that will.  Her crying and pain will eventually stop.  If you have kids, think about them if you decide to split.  Do not use them as pawns to get to your spouse.  If they do, know there is nothing you can do, but to tell your kids the truth, depending on the age, and continue to let them know you love them.  In the long run they will know the truth.  My children are starting to move away from their father as when they go to visit him, he constantly says bad things about me.  I do not talk of him.  And hey he is the one with the live in girlfriend.  Ironic don't you think.  In that he is with someone, I don't care, and he is the one that pushes the kids away because he can't stop saying nasty things about me.  Good Luck to you in whatever you decide to do, it may take time, but everything will be ok.
7	A naughty joke again? A little rural town had one of the highest birth rates in the country and this phenomenon attracted the attention of the sociologists at the state university. They wrote a grant proposal got a huge chunk of money moved to town set up their computers got squared away and began designing their questionnaires and such.While the staff was busy getting ready for their big research effort, the project director decided to go to the local drugstore for a cup of coffee. He sat down at the counter, ordered his coffee, and while he was drinking it, he told the druggist what his purpose was in town, then asked him if he had any idea why the birth rate was so high.\n"Sure," said the druggist. "Every morning the FOUR o'clock train comes through here and blows for the crossing. It wakes everybody up, and, well, it's too late to go back to sleep, and it's too early to get up." Very cool.... keep posting....

6	What does the term "yankee" mean, anyways? The term Yankee has a variety of meanings. Generally, it refers to citizens of the United States, particularly northerners, especially those Americans from the Northeastern United States.\n\nOrigins of the term are disputed. One theory customarily held by persons not from New England claims that it originated from the Dutch in old New Amsterdam (today known as New York City) in the Mid-Atlantic States. It then was adopted by the British as a pejorative for (Northern) colonists. The origin might have been the phrase Jan Kees ("John Cornelius") (two very common Dutch names), which the English-speaking people picked up as "yankees", a word they used to refer to the Dutch.\n\nThe Dutch theory is somewhat confused. The settlers of New Amsterdam and the settlers of Massachusetts Bay were totally unconnected and did not come into contact until both communities were sufficiently dense to carry on trade up and down the East Coast. There is no reason why the British should call English settlers in a different location by a Dutch name when New Amsterdam was under Dutch jurisdiction and always had been. Moreover, New York has never been "Yankee" except in the world wars of modern times.\n\nThe prevalent theory in New England holds that it originated among a group of Indigenous peoples of the Americas on the East Coast of the United States. They were unable to pronounce the word "English", rendering it as "yengis" or "yengeese". This later was Anglicized to "Yankees".\n\nThis theory is widely held, as descendants of those same Native Americans are alive in Massachusetts, mainly as the Wampanoags and are vociferous about their origin and are fairly well publicized. They still know the basic core of their former language and are able to say that in it there is no "l" sound. Their ancestors would not have pronounced it, rendering English to "yengis".\n\nIn another theory, Indians who first learned of the English from the French may have borrowed the French language name "Anglais" and rendered it as something that approximated "Yankee" in their own phonetic system. One area in which French, French-allied Indians, and British-descended Americans would have come into contact was the area of frontier warfare conducted during the French and Indian War (1754–1763). This is more or less consistent with the areas in which other derivations of the word would postulate its first use. If this is the origin of the term Yankee, it may originally have had a pejorative, anti-American connotation similar to that of gringo, becoming adopted as a matter of pride by British-descended Americans who had fought on the frontier during the French and Indian War.\n\nThere are several other folk and humorous etymologies for the word.\n\nOne influence on the use of the term throughout the years has been the song Yankee Doodle, which was popular at the time of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Though the British intended to insult the colonials with the song, following the Battle of Concord, it was adopted by Americans as a proud retort and today is the state song of Connecticut.\n\nAn early use of the term outside the United States was in the creation of Sam Slick, the "Yankee Clockmaker", in a column in a newspaper in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1835. The character was a plain-talking American who served to mock both American and British North American customs of that era. The stories were published in a book titled The Clockmaker, in 1836. The book was popular in British North America, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

It means that you ought to pay attention to what you really want to do. There is some creative idea bubbling inside of you, and you are probably afraid to let it out. I don't know what it is, but you are supposed to do something original, to what your heart pulls you.

1	Please refer to the details section for this math question that I need help with.? I have the answer but need to be able to show work for it\n\nQuestion:\n\nJuan, a landscaper in Alburquerque, designing a spring display of tulips and daffodils. The city has requested a 6-ft by 8-ft area of tulips surrounded by a uniform border of daffodils. The total area of tulips are daffodils is to be 100 ft^2. How wide should the border be?\n\nAnswer: -7+(SquareRoot of 101)/2 = 1.52 FT There is a rectangle, 6x8 inside of a larger rectangle.  The distance between the inner and outer is "x", and we're assuming it's uniform all the way around.\n\nSo the 6ft side of the rectangle has x on the left and x on the right, so the total side is 6 + 2x.  The 8ft side has x on top and x on bottom, or 8 + 2x total.\n\nArea is length * width, and you know total area, border and all, is 100.\n\n100 = (6+2x)(8+2x)\n\n100 = 48 + 28x + 4x^2 <--- you can divide through by 4 here\n\n25 = 12 + 7x + x^2; make the equation = 0 by subtracting 25 from both sides, and reorder a bit:\n\n0 = x^2 + 7x - 13\n\nNow use quadratic formula to solve for x; when ax^2 + bx + c = 0; x = [-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)]/2a\n\nso for x^2 + 7x - 13 = 0 a is 1; b is 7; and c is -13\n\nx = [-7 +/- sqrt(7^2 - (4)(1)(-13)]/2*1 \n\n= [-7 +/- sqrt(49 + 52)]/2\n\n= [-7 +/- sqrt(101)]/2 <-- you would only consider the plus, since -7 minus sqrt101 would give you a negative number, thus your answer\n\nx = [-7 + sqrt(101)]/2 = approx. 1.52 ft

Now the wedding has turned into this big deal with bridal parties and receptions and since I have gotten to know her better, I do not want to have anything to do with her.  Here are some examples:\n1.  Calls me very late at night repeatedly, drunk, when she knows I get up at 5AM\n2.  She gets jealous when I talk to other women and once tipped a beer up while someone was taking a drink making it spill all over her.\n3.  Tells people that she is so much happier then me and mine when people ask her about the age difference between her and her four month beau\n4.  Tells people that me and mine have issues together and seperate\n5.  Drinks everyday\n6.  Lifted up my skirt in a barroom full of people when I was wearing a thong - twice!\n7.  Flirts with men and tries to make me an accomplice\nShould I stick it out or get out now?  Wedding is 9/3 I would just drop all contact with her.  If you have caller I.D. and you see her # don't pick up the phone.  Eventually even slower people will get the picture on that one!
9	Moving to Canada but waiting for family class permanent residency. What should I do? Hi,\n\nI've applied for permanent residency in Canada using the family class. My wife is Canadian, I'm British, and I don't really expect any problems with receiving the permanent residency.\n\nThe question I have is this: I don't expect to receive my residency visa before I intend to travel to Canada. Given that I'm a British citizen, and can visit Canada for up to 6 months without a visa, do I need to do anything prior to heading to Canada (like get a temporary residents visa?). \n\nI don't want to have any problems on arrival at Canadian immigration when they ask me how long I intend to stay in Canada, and I answer, indefinitely, dependent on my permanent residency visa coming through. \n\nSuggestions, thoughts, advice appreciated.\n\nRegards,\nKarl As far as I understand, it's okay to enter on a 6 months visitor's visa.  In fact, it is now possible to enter the country on the visitor's visa and THEN apply for permanent residency using the family class.  Apparently it is even faster this way.\n\nIt makes sense, as long as you are clear to immigration that you are entering the country as a visitor and are prepared to depart in six months if your permanent residency doesn't come through.  But if you declare at immigration you are intending to reside here, and you don't have your permanent residency yet, that may pose a problem for you at the border .\n\nMy father is entering this way and has communicated with Canadian immigration to confirm this is okay.  But please don't take this as advice, just anecdotal experience.

Now I am 22 I'm having doubts if I really am or not.\nI have never had a relationship with a girl, although I have considered it & as far as having sex with one, it was disasterous to say the least! got nothing from it & it happened ONCE when I was 19, 3 1/2 years ago... afterwards I shunned it aside (hurt her) and I came out shortly afterwards as gay when I was 20.\nI have had many boyfriends in the past & recently split with one. I kind of find some girls attractive, sexually... does it mean i am bisexual but yet to explore the other half of my sexuality? I came out 2 years ago as gay... would this mean I have to come out again but as bisexual?  One of my gay friends says I am bisexual because he's never experienced sexual feelings for a woman.  I have, but ALOT MORE SO guys.  My other gay friend says it's a phase and if I try with a girl, it wouldn't work and i'll end up back with a guy.\n\nHelp?

6	After I retired, can I live in VietNam but still collect my money.? There are many American citizens who live outside the country while retired. This is because the cost of living is usually much less than that in America. At this time, Vietnam's cost of living is approximately 1/8th that of living in America. You can live comfortable on about $300/month in Vietnam where you could barely live a week on that in America. That in mind, you can see why it is very attractive to live aborad while retired.\n\nHow most retired people are able to live in another country is rather simple. They maintain their U.S. citizenship, a U.S. address, pay their U.S. taxes and regularly travel back to the U.S. to pick up their mail and/or retirement checks. \n\nIf planning to live in Vietnam, you will need to make sure your visa will be valid long enough to stay as long as you are there. Vietnam had given the U.S. favored nation status a few years ago (although the favor has not been reciprocated as of yet), which will make it relatively easy to stay there as long as you want. \n\nHave a good retirement!

9	Does anyone know where to get the actual process for U.S. immigration?? I'm writting a story on immigration and I want the real process...not just opinions of what the process should be...thanks so freaken much!! I can give you the general process. A U.S citizen can file an immigrant visa I-130 for his/her spouse, fiancee, children, son, daughter married and unmarried, parents, siblings. The I-130 petition is usually filed with the local BCIS (formerly INS) office. After approval this petition is forwarded to National Visa Center in New Hempshire. NVC completes certain requirements like Affidavit of support from the petitioner.  After that the file is forwarded to the overseas U.S embassy or consulate having jusrisdiction over the place of beneficiary's place of residence.  The Embassy then calls in the beneficiary for an interview and reviews all the local documentation as well. If every thing is in order an immigrant visa is issued.\n\nA green card holder can also file an immigrant visa petititon but only for spouse, children, unmarried sons and daughter.\n\nNow there are two basic categories one is called Immediate relative category and other one is preference category.  Immediate relative categories are not governed by any quota and all the applicants filing are processed e.g. spouse, children under 21 and parents of U.S citizen. All other categories are governed by a quota set by the federal government for each country per year. For example when a green card holder files a petition for the spouse the waiting period in this category is approximately 4 years.\n\nTo obtain further information on cutoff priority dates for preference categories check the following link:\n\nhttp://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/bulletin/bulletin_1770.html

My first time out we went to the Gnadenhutten, OH - Movarian Indian massacre site (now a park). Across the street from it is a cemetery.\n\nAnyhow, we took an Olympus digital recorder set on manual record. My fiance' and son went out and took pictures and I started talking into the recorder.\n\nWhen we got home we were shocked at the results. I got some very strong EVPs from that location.\nThere was a lawn mower going over in the cemetery so I think that worked as white noise. Since then I haven't had quite as good of luck but I have managed to get a couple of others.\nThe best results I have gotten I had something electrical in the back ground.  I have tried recording with no white noise and not gotten anything. But I'm so new at it I can't say that you defintely need or don't need white noise.\n\nI do know that you should say Hello and talk as if you believe you are talking to someone.\n\nYou should record for only a few minutes at a time. When playing back its easier to analyze small chunks rather than an hour or so.\n\nIf you are recording talk in a normal voice and if something happens in the distance like a car drives by or a dog barks, say something on the recorder about it so you aren't trying to remember if thats real or an EVP.\n\nDon't listen to the recordings til you are done with the site. Its best to listen to them in a quiet place that you are comfortable with - in case there is someting on there that shocks or frightens you.\n\nAlways be respectful. Do not taunt or torment anyone or anything.\n\nNot all spooky, old places are haunted. Not all cemeteries are peaceful.\n\nIf you'd like to hear my EVPs, please feel free to IM me and I will send a link to them. They are on Putfile.com.

0	How did "No." ever become the abbreviation for number?  There's no "O" in number.? The Latin explanation is correct, but it's slightly more complex than that.  "Numero" actually means "in number".\n\nThe basic form of the word in Latin is "numerus".  "Numero" is  the "ablative case" form.  The ablative form was used here because that fit the usage English writers needed when they introduced the form into English in the 17th century  (in expressions of the sort "men, in number three").\n\nA couple of notes on this form & how to use it:\n\n1) The numero sign used to always use a RAISED (or "superscript") O.  (Typewriters could not handle this very well, unless you wanted to manually move the carriage up and down.  But wordprocessing, personal computing make it much easier.)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign \n\nThis use of a superscript at the end is another indicator that it is the letter stands for the case ENDING, rather than, say, the second letter of the word.  (The practice of abbreviating a word by its first letter or two plus the case ending is ancient.  For example, in the early church --by the 2nd century-- copies of the Greek New Testament would abbreviate the divine names by using the first letter or two followed by the case ending, with a line over the whole to mark it as an abbreviation.)\nhttp://www.skypoint.com/~waltzmn/NominaSacra.html\n\n2) Even though the abbreviation is borrowed from the Latin, you should never SAY the Latin word when you see it.  That's just an unusual habit in English -- to use Latin abbreviations to stand for English words.  \n\nIn the same way, when you see "e.g." you say "for example"; for "i.e." say "that is", for "viz." say "namely"; for "cf." say "compare"; and for "etc." say "and so forth".  (Many other European languages have equivalent abbreviations, but base them on their OWN language.)\nSee: http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19971217\nand list - http://list-of-latin-phrases.area51.ipupdater.com/

2	I am reading this book 'It happened to Nancy" and I was wondering ...? If you get The HIV virus from kissing someone or sharing a drink?It said with the swap of bodily fluids?does that include spit?or just like when you have a cut or sore in your mouth?Is it possible to just get it by a drink or kissing with no cuts or sores? Which body fluids can transmit the HIV virus, and which ones don't?\n\nBlood, pre-cum, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk all contain high concentrations of HIV, and all have been linked to transmission of the virus. \n\nSaliva, tears, sweat and urine can have the virus in them, but in such small concentrations that nobody has ever been infected through them. However, if any body fluid is visibly contaminated with blood, the risk of transmission exists. \n\n\n\n\nHow is HIV transmitted?\nHIV must get into your bloodstream in order to infect you. If it doesn't get into the bloodstream, you will not get the infection. Blood, pre-cum, semen, vaginal secretions or breast milk must have direct access to your bloodstream in order to infect you. Activities where this can happen include vaginal intercourse (both partners), anal intercourse (both partners), giving oral sex, sharing needles (IV drugs, tattooing, etc.) and, rarely, through receiving a blood transfusion. HIV can also be transmitted from mother to child. HIV is not transmitted through any form of casual contact. \nIn summary, in order for infection to occur, three things must happen: \n\nYou must be exposed to pre-cum, semen, vaginal secretions, blood or breast milk, AND \nThe virus must get directly into your bloodstream through some fresh cut, open sore, abrasion etc., AND \nTransmission must occur, directly from one person to the other, very quickly (the virus does not survive more than a few minutes outside the body).\nNo matter what the circumstances are, if you think about these three criteria for transmission, you'll be able to determine whether you're at risk for HIV or not. But do remember that other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can be transmitted more easily than HIV, so what might be low risk for HIV may be high risk for other STDs.
4	(about JAVA)A small question on this small piece of code...? In the code written here:\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java:Swing\nhow can I call a function when there is a mouse press/release for a button The code on wikibooks actually calls System.exit(0) when the exit button is pressed.\nThe code segment is below\n\n        //Creates a button on the calculator that can be used to close the program\n        JButton buttonExit = new JButton("Exit");\n//Creates a keyboard shortcut of Alt+C to use to close the program //instead of having to click on the button\n        buttonExit.setMnemonic(KeyEvent.VK_C);\n        buttonExit.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {\n                public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n                System.exit(0); \n                }\n        });\n        //adds the Exit button\n        panel.add(buttonExit);\n\nThere are two ways of doing what you would like.\nFirstly, you could copy the 'buttonExit.addActionListener(..); part to every other button and make the function actionPerformed in the new ActionListener do what you would like.  For instance, you could get it to write to the console with a line like\nSystem.out.println("You pressed the button xx");\ndepending on which button was pressed.\n\nSecondly, you could create a seperate ActionListener and implement in the actionPerformed method checks to see which button was pressed.  Note, this would need to be a seperate class.  For instance\nclass FullActionListener // the action listener for all buttons\npublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n    String command = e.getActionCommand();\n    if (command.equals("9")) {\n        // do whatever you need to here for the button 9.\n        System.out.println("You pressed button 9");\n    } else if (command.equals("8")) {\n        // etc\n    }\n}\n\nThen,\nActionListener al = new FullActionListener();\n// the code on wikibooks\n        //creates all of the numbers that would be seen on a calculator\n        JButton button1 = new JButton("1");\n        button1.addActionListener(al);\n        panel.add(button1);\n        JButton button2 = new JButton("2");\n        button2.addActionListener(al);\n        panel.add(button2);\n etc...
0	Should we worship saints? Use bible references in your answer if you can.  Usually I choose as best answer the one with well applied scriptures. Lev 19:4 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I [am] the LORD your God. Lev 26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up [any] image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I [am] the LORD your God. \nLev 26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. \nDeu 29:17 And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which [were] among them\n1Ki 15:12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. \n1Ki 21:26 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all [things] as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. \n2Ki 17:12 For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.

2	does any body know if pollen travells through airconditioning in a house? im allergic to it,   but im so hot locked in my house,\n i need my aircon Yes. It depends on how good or how clean the filters are, how old the machine is, whether it's a window unit or central air, etc. And pollen can get into a house many other ways... not just through air conditioners. People bring it in on their clothing, pets bring it in, it can come through cracks in doors and windows, etc. Go ahead and use the air conditioner. It probably won't make much difference in the pollen count inside the house.

2	Jogging... treadmill or outside? How long? What is an average amount of time that people jog on a treadmill? Do they jog for 10 mins, walk a few, then jog more, etc.? \n\nOr is it more healthy to jog straight for 20 minutes? Or more!?\n\nWhat is best for your body?\n\nAnd... how much more energy does it take to jog outside, rather then on a treadmill?\n\nThanks. You should jog at a comfortable pace (you should be able to say a sentence semi-comfortably) for more than twenty minutes. Slow down if you need to. Stop if you have any chest pain. \n\nThe first 5 minutes or so are more of a warm-up: go a little slower at first, then increase your speed. Also, cool-down after your 20 minutes are up (start with a power walk and wind down to a good "mall pace"). Don't forget to stretch before and after a workout- it will make your workout more productive. \n\nAs for the workout itself, for the first 20 minutes, you're getting cardio benefits (aerobic exercise). After 20 minutes, you're in anaerobic exercise...you're no longer burning fat, but building muscle. Muscle will increase your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which will increase the caloric need of your body...so it helps you to lose even more weight!\n\nAs for treadmills v. outside: it's a matter of person preference: \nTreadmills:\n   Advantages: help you keep up your pace, can vary terrain/incline to your preference, can see the calories you're burning \n   Disadvantage: sometimes it can be more difficult to breathe indoors\nOutside: \n   Advantages: ever-changing scenery, cleaner air \n   Disadvantage:less control over terrain/incline\n\n\nEnergy requirements depend on the speed, duration, and incline of your workout, as well as your current health status.

1	Please define  Phase, neutral and earth of Electricity? what is the difference between neutral and earth? Detailed answer, please Well, "Phase" is applicable to alternating current, or "AC", and describes the relative change in voltage around a central or "neutral" level. The term "earth" was derived from the potential ( or voltage) of the physical Earth on which we live. Since it is such a large mass, it's electrical potential is considered to be zero volts.\n\nNow, the power stations all generate electricity at a voltage which is relative to earth, and these days is generally of the AC variety (compared to DC, or Direct Current). Anyway, when the power lines are distributed from a power station, they are sent in pairs, one is "active" or "live" and the other is "neutral". The neutral line is connected directly to the earth at the power station. Now either the neutral wire or the physical earth (Earth) can be used as the return path to the power station. In damp earth conditions, the physical Earth does a great job, however in dry conditions, the neutral wire is best, even though there is a small resistance in the power cables back to the power station.\n\nSo, I guess, the difference between neutral and earth is the resistance of the power cables or the conductivity of the Earth.\n\nHope this is not too confusing!

Since your budget seems willing to spend a little. Here is a great idea. Since you have created your list. Look in your photo albums and find your favorite (nice) picture of you and your friend (each of them or you all as a group). Go have copies made and buy frames for them. Take the time to hand write out what made you pick that friend and that picture. It will make the reciever appreciate your friendship knowing that you think the world of them. Put the nice picture in a box and wrap it up with bows and ribbon. It will be a unique gift. Or you could scrapbook them a page and frame it of your fav. times together. Good luck and Merry Christmas

0	This question is ONLY for Muslims...Please Read, I need help!!? Well, first off, I am a 23 yr old caucasian American girl who was born into Christianity. My whole entire life I have never felt a connection to Christianity and I have never been able to accept Jesus as my God. For the past 5 years now I have been researching Islam, reading the Qur'an and familiarizing myself with the Muslim religion. I feel that Islam is the religion for me, 100%. I, with all my heart, want to convert to Islam. However, I am afraid that I will not be accepted by Allah because of all the herendous sins I have commited in my considerably short life. Sins including drug use, being promiscuous, having a child out of wedlock, stealing and lying. I regret my sins so much that it makes me physically and mentally ill. I wish so much that I could be forgiven for my sins and live a pure life. So I guess what my questions are is, can I be a Muslim considering the horrible sins I have committed? Would a Muslim man be allowed to marry me? I am worthy of Islam? Please help me... I am going to be very blunt with you. Like it or not, your post made the hair on my arm stand on ends!\nThis is Hypocrisy at it is best.  You were born into a Christian family, lived you whole life as one, and yet you have lived your life as you pleased without any consideration to what you might do, and what might happen to you, and then you won't to convert to Islam, implying that your free life was caused by you being Christian not by what you have done.  Don't blame Christianity for your past life, and now you are looking for a way out!\n\nIf you truely regret your sinns, then you should confuse your sins to God and never do them again.  Not leave God, not abandon God, and pretend you are looking for the right path! you seem had never been on the right path.  And you are worried if a Muslim man will marry you! you better believe it, many will be happy to marry a convert to their faith.  After all, you have forsaken your religion for theirs.\n\nCan you be a Muslim? Yes you can. and don't forget that Muslims also sin, they are not far from sinning nor are they Angels, if that what you think.\nA Muslim man is allowed to marry you.  Don't put yourself down so much.  You sinned, so what, everyone sinned one time or another, some sinn more than other, but we all sin, inculding the Muslims, and those whom you think are worth more than you.  You sound as if you are begging for a Muslim man to marry you.  Look for a Good man, not just a muslim man. \n\nNow I am going to get it for this.  Islam is not worthy of you.  Help you!! God help those who help themselves.  If you ever been a christian then this blessing for you.  If you think Islam is 100% for you, then you should learn a little more of what you may go into.  \n\nIN the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy SPirit may you have peace in your heart, soul and spirit.  \nDon't forsaken your Lord who put his life on the line for you, and never forget his teaching.  Amen.\n\nADD:\nI regret posting this message to you, not because I don't believe in what I say, but because you will not hear my words.  I wish you well.  Muslims claim to say they believe in Jesus Christ, and at the same time, they don't give him the proper respect.  I know the muslims so well.  If you are really a christian! Islam is not for you, believe me.  But it is up to you.  Think hard, long and wise.  Finding a man to marry you, not so hard to do.  I say this to you with all respect.\n\nI like to ask you a question, if I may!\n\nThey tell you by converting to Islam that all your past sins will be forgiven?! Don't believe it.  the question.  How do he Muslims get their past sins forgiven!! do they convert to Christianity?  \nIn the time of the judgment day, Jesus Christ will be the one who will be judging you. Christians and Muslims believe he will return for the judgment day, not Muhammad, But Jesus Christ.  Ever wonder why it is Jesus and not Muhammad!  think about it, and you will know why.  Don't forget that.  \n\nTHINK HARD, LONG and be WISE.  and Good luck to you.\n\nWATCH THESE, AND IF YOU STILL THINK ISLAM IS GOOD FOR WOMEN, THEN GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

1	what is 13 SEER energy mandate? There’s a New Minimum Efficiency Standard for 2006\nLike many consumer products that use energy, air conditioners and heat pumps are manufactured to meet or exceed minimum efficiency standards set by the U.S. Department of Energy. For nearly a decade, that minimum has been 10 SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio). On January 23, 2006, the minimum will jump to 13 SEER, a 30% increase over the current standard.

1	before rain, the weather are very hot....why ? Because hot air holds more water.  Hot air also seeks to rise, which pushes down cold air.  As it mingles with the cold air, it loses some of its heat.  When the air reaches a cool enough temperature for the amount of water it has in it - it rains.
0	Why don't Seventh DAy Adventists eat pork or shellfish? Read Leviticus 11\n\nIf you don't have a bible at home use this website   http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2011%20;&version=31;\n\nGod told the Israelites what animals He approved of them eating. Science is just now learning the whys and wherefores. Most of the creatures listed as unclean have high levels of colesterol which leads to heart disease. Many have diseases that are only just now being controlled by vaccines and medicines. These dietary laws were given to prevent the people from eating food that might harm them.\nAnd it goes back long before the book of Leviticus.\nWhen the animals were going into the ark they were already listed as clean or unclean by God so this is not just something to be discarded because Jesus came to earth.\nSee  Genesis 7, a lot of people miss this point. There were seven of the clean animals and only two of unclean. So, God classified the animals long before Moses was born.  These are not superfluous words such as were written telling people they could only walk so far on the Sabbath, and they shouldn't light a fire. Those rules (I don't call them laws because they were written by sadducees) were not from God but from men who foolishly thought they could work their way into heaven.  There is a big difference between manmade law and Gods laws.\n\nMany people use the experience of Peters' vision to say it's okay to eat everything. But Peter explained that vision as meaning all people were clean and it was acceptable to socialise with them. He NEVER  interpreted that vision as actually cleansing all animals.\n\nWhat's more, people who say that vision means all animals are clean are two faced in that they don't normally eat oppossum, skunk, snakes, rats, mice.  SO, you see even they still make some of their own distinction between clean and unclean.\n\nREST MY CASE.........

If your desktop does not have a WIFI network card, get one for it too so you do not have to use cable. Otherwise, get the desktop close to the router and cable to it. There are lots of sites dealing with networking issues. They even describe a step-by-step procedure that anyone can follow.

If she really was your friend in the first place she wouldnt care about your size.

4	every thing I type in my messenger comes out as black boxes and zeros. How do I fix this? Usually this means that you have selected an indisplayable font--you should try changing the font your messenger is using to something usual like Arial. Japanese writing on a web page, without the japanese font in your windows font directory, will result in these same boxes and zeros.
1	solve this chemistry enigma ??plzzzzzzzzz...? an organic compound A of molecular formula C2H6O on oxidation gives an acid B with the same no of carbon atoms as A . compound A  is often used for STERLIZISATION OF SKIN by doctors. name the compund A AND B . WRITE THE CHEMICAL EQUATION involved in the formation of B from A . IT  would be helpful if u tell be what is sterilization of skin ????????? Your compound A is ethanol: H3C-CH2OH.  It is an alcohol which can be used for sterilizing (killing germs) on surfaces.  Ever see an old western movie where they get a bottle of whiskey and dribble some over the knife blade before they start to cut open the wound to remove the arrow?  That's what ethanol can do.\n\nBy oxidizing ethanol, you can create ethanoic acid, otherwise known as acetic acid: H3C-C(O)-OH\n\nH3CCH2OH  + O2  ======>  H3C-C(O)OH  + H20

Like blasting it somehow with ir radiation? so if i'm driving down a road and there is a passive ir sensor, is there any way to activate that sensor before i get.  will shining an infrared led work?  or anything else? infared light will only work if it is an infared censor. it could be radar or pocibly even metal detection(if it isnt measuring speed). dont forget that you would need a very very bright infared light, a little LED wont cut it. remember that the sun shines infared light so your light would have to be strong enough to confuse the censor.
6	Best website to open a stock portfolio? I finally have money to invest but Im not sure what company I want to open it with. Some offer a fee, some dont. Some offer more stock than others. Is there a company with a cheap entrance fee that also has a vast list of tradable stocks? I would love to find a site that trades high performance stocks but ALSO trades penny stocks. Serious answers only please\n\nThanks I saw someone answer with a bunch of websites. Some websites are good mind you. But since you are dealing with the Internet you are going to get some serious information overload.\n\n"Some offer more stock than others."\nAre you sure you know what you are doing? A stock is a stock and it only goes for one price. No one can give discounts.\n\nI say who cares about the cheap entrance fee. I see someone above referred to some cheap stuff, go with that - but cheap entry fees to buy stocks should be the least of your worries. \n\n'I would love to find a site that trades high performance stocks but ALSO trades penny stocks. "\n\nIf you are looking for a guru or a hot tip. Forget it. If things like that work, those people won't be giving away their knowledge freely. And if it were that easy we would all be doing it. \n\nKeep reading and educating yourself and good luck!
1	Can Santa really come through a microwave oven? Yes, considering santa always enters through a chimney (due to him being traditional), even if there is no fire place, he can enter through a microwave oven.  Houses that don't have fireplaces, generally have some sort of small vent which is essentially the chimney.  This would then generally lead to some sort of grating which would be far too small for a man to compress himself and fit through.  \n\nTherefore, santa must teleport.  His mass is converted into energy and then re assembles elsewhere.  Since microwave radiation is a form of energy, he can surely enter a home through a microwave oven

0	Where us the most haunted place in the world? Alton, Illinois is said to be one of the most haunted cities in the world.  It was the site of a prison during the Civil War with particularly harsh treatment of prisoners.  After the war, the prison stood for a while, then people started taking the stones from the walls and distributed them throughout the town, using them for walls and all sorts of things.  It is believed the spirits of those who suffered followed the stones.  \n\nProbably the most haunted buildling in the world is the Tower of London, site of hundreds of executions.  Ghosts here include animals from a menagerie that was once kept on the grounds, two young princes who were killed there, Queen Anne Boleyn (said to lead a ghostly procession of lords and ladies to her grave), and the Countess of Salisbury -- 70 at the time of her execution, she refused to lay her head on the chopping block and ran, causing the executioner to chase her and hack at her neck until she died.  It is said that the countess can be seen re-enacting her death.

I read the following from hoopsworld.com:\n\n"Ernie Johnson is one of my heroes and is simply in my mind one of the best of the television commentators in his role with TNT. The recent disclosure that he suffers and has been treated for a fairly common but somewhat mysterious form of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma commonly known as a follicular type is surely a sad thing, but this is a type of cancer that people often live many years with and treatments continue to evolve. \n\nThis point was stressed in a statement released by the Atlanta Sports Network and also found on USA Today on the 22nd:\n\n"Two and a half years ago, in August of 2003, I was diagnosed with 'follicular' Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. This is a low-grade and treatable cancer -- not as aggressive as some other forms...The only reason I'm bringing my condition to your attention now is because the swelling of a lymph node near my left ear has become noticeable to viewers of TNT and there have been questions asked." \n\nIn the same statement it was also mentioned that he plans to seek some additional treatment after the end of the year."

0	How do you like getting "party" invitations, which are only asking you to stop by and spend your money? I don't mean to offend, but I get really sick of the tired old direct sales tactic- send out a cutsie and personalized invitation to someone's house so you can give them your money for crap you don't want.  Just in the last month I've been "invited" to parties for Mary Kay, Pampered Chief, Layers, a Sleepover party, Cookie Lee and Usborne books.  I think they're all overpriced and a waste of time I could be spending with my hubby when he gets home from work.  If I don't buy, I feel guilty.  If I do, I end up feeling lide I paid too much for a product I could buy at Target (except Usborne, I think they have a good product.)   I don't think it's right for people to depend on their friends and neighbors for an income, whether large or small..  What's your opinion? I hate those things too.  If I get one with an RSVP I'll return it declining the invitation.  If not, I just don't go.  If asked I'll simply say I'm not interested in the product or that I have other plans.  I don't get invited to many of these so-called parties anymore.\n\nFace it, if you lose friendships because you don't supplement their income then they weren't really friendships to start with.\n\nIf you feel bad about declining the invitations throw a dinner or cocktail party of your own where you don't expect people to spend money.  It works for me.

0	What is the role of religion in society? At what point in the development of societies did religion, or at least some form of pre-religious organized belief structure, come to exist?\n\nHow and why did religion form? Is it merely the result of the organization of beliefs, or does religion fulfill a particular societal need? Put another way, is religion the organization of a primarily personal phenomenon, or is it more societal in nature? What is the relationship between the individual, the religion and the society?\n\nIf religion fulfills certain societal or personal needs, what are these needs, and can they be fulfilled outside religion? How are they fulfilled today, if they are? It is the moral fabric and value system that people need.  Faith gives life a purpose and meaning.  The church itself provides a supportive community for individuals in many phases of life.  The church can be a loving, supportive, but also disciplining part of the person's life.  The people of the faith community provide a lot of benevolent care to the needy of the community and do it out of their own time and pocketbook.    Faith in God continually points away from a self centered view of life to caring about others and giving to the needs of our immediate community.

I'm assuming that people could buy it now and then turn around and sell it on or after April 25th while pocketing the $10 per share.\n\nAm I misunderstanding the possibility (or non-possibility) here? The thing is, when a stock goes ex-dividend, the share price gets adjusted by the amount of money taken out by the dividend...  The other problem is that the Dolan family is just plain scary...  Just look at the Knicks!

1	can a flea see the moon? A flea doesn't have the visual acuity to be able to discern the moon.  It takes an eye of a certain minimum size to be able to do that, for reasons of optics and length of wavelength of visible light.
5	Should you train with traditional kung fu weapons (i.e. Kwan taos, 9 section chain whips, iron fans)? not only do you learn more about evading and generating energy with sparring with weapons. the weapon it self offers resistance training, and everything done with a weapon (no matter what weapon it happens to be) can be directly translated into a fist fight. weapon training is a very important building block to the fighter's technique.

3	why should we kept the SAT? why It is a test of a person's academic achievement, which is also an indication of ability.  For example:  They may be able to form a proper question, that is grammatically correct.  \n\nIt is not "kept".... but "keep" and perhaps your writing problem is why you do not like the SAT, since you also gave no other reason for your argument.\n\n\nGood Luck!\nSue
1	What is the viewing resolution of the human eye? I know the eye works differently from a computer screen, and that we have rods and cones instead of pixels. But if we converted the resolution of what our eyes see into a computer or any other format, how fine a detail can we see? Not just clarity or blurriness, but the actual resolution. 0.01 millimeter is the resolution the human eye can detect and differentiate two points as two different point.
6	Anyone know the best way to get financing (grants etc) to start a new business, I am talking over 100,000? business Contact the Small Business Administration.  Be sure you have a solid business plan together. There are some banks that advertise there connection with the SBA, IE Charter Bank in Michigan was one of them. That does not guarantee the grants or free money.  It IS very difficult to land an SBA loan or grant with new business's.  Minority owned business's have a better chance.
8	Where have all the nice guy gone? I am an 18 year old poetry girl from Ohio. I want to find someone who can understand me, talk with me, and keep my thoughts happy. I am sweet and caring, maybe a little too much. I always see the good in everyone and thus found a variety of jerks out there. I just want for once to find a guy where chivalry is not a thing of the past and a rose is a reminder of love, not a way to get into bed. If I am wrong to want this, fine then. If by chance though, there is a guy out there who fits this, maybe there is hope. \n\nIf you think you want to take a chance let me know. Still feel free to comment though. My IM is writing_kitten. Later guys! I know what you mean but forget those other guys I'm here

3	Compare and explain the different types of electromagnetic waves.? Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that occurs in waves. As such, different types have different wavelengths and frequencies. The highest energy (smallest wavelength and greatest frequency) is Gamma rays. Next is infrared rays. Decreasing in energy, next is ultraviolet rays. Then comes the range of light that we can see, called accordingly, visible light. With lower energy than that is microwaves and radio waves which have the longest wavelengths and shortest frequencies.

DOC. \nIn 1937, these diminuitive heroes found their way into the hearts of young people throughout the land. Millions of children embraced the myth of the friendly, protective dwarfs who befriended Snow White. \n\nWhat lies beneath the story? Seven shrunken men shacked up in a secluded forest cabin, hiding a virginal teenage runaway. Seven tortured forms shouldering their demonic tools as they march into the hellish bowels of the earth, singing as they go. Harmless mythic munchkins or the epitome of Evil? You decide. \n\nAdditional Details\n\n\nhttp://deadlysins.com/features/snow.html...\nThis is where I got my info. from. I didn't think of it.... uhm. I like the 7 dwarfs. It's just a cartoon.

6	I've sent off my resume, what should I do now? Ok, so I just got laid off and I'm looking for a job online.\n\nI've sent my resume to many different companies and I wanna stand out from the (im guessing hundreds) of other applicants trying to get the same job.\n\nWhat should I do now?  Anyone try anything that works? About a week after you send out your resume you can call the HR department to confirm that it was received. Hopefully you'll get called for an interview.\n\nOne thing that really does make an impact is to send a thank you note to the people who interviewed you following the interview. Not everyone takes the time to do this and I have seen it make a difference. It worked on me once or twice when I was in the position to hire someone.

5	what's the difference between a "world champion" and an "international champion" in boxing? the only real difference is the boxing sanctions.  theres the WBF(world boxing association) WBC(World Boxing Council) IBF (International Boxing federation) IBO (International Boxing Organization) and a few more.  They're just different sanctions for the purpose of making more money.  But of course there could be a boxer who wins the nationaal championship in his country, and then travels to another country and challenges they're national champion and wins.  he'd be holding national championships from two different countries.  which would by definition make him an international champion.  Hope i was of some help to you.
0	If Jesus had a son, what would it be? Would it be halve human halve god like and when that son had a child and so on\n\nSo who is Jesus' sons great grandson/daughter and are they god like Why does this kind of nonsense puzzle people?\n\nLook, the whole Jesus story reads a little too much like old Greek legends.  Hercules was half human, half god.  No big deal.\n\nThe fact that Jesus was god, or semi-god, but still could be killed by a bunch of Jews/Romans...what kind of god is that?  Or that people make a fuss if Jesus did something actually human like had sex or fathered children...why?  I would not worship some god that appeared to be human and ended up getting killed as a virgin in his mid 30s.  \n\nThe inane "Da Vinci Code" crowd, of course thinks Jesus's children were the Merovingians, some Frankish (French) kings with long hair.  Whop de de.  I imagine if Jesus had children, they would like middle eastern kids--like Israelis or Palestinian kids.  But would they have their daddy's "magic"?  Leave me alone.  It doesn't matter.  Look outside.  This world is a mess.  If Jesus had kids, they didn't do a very good job against the forces of evil.
3	What is the meaning of "The 5th Column" and "Mea Culpa" ?? Mea Culpa is a Latin phrase that translates into English as "my fault", or "my own fault". In order to emphasize the message, the adjective "maxima" may be inserted, resulting in "mea maxima culpa," which would translate as "my most [grievous] fault."\n\nA fifth column is a group of people which clandestinely undermines a larger group to which it is expected to be loyal, such as a nation.\n\nThe term originated with a 1936 radio address by Emilio Mola, a nationalist general during the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War. As four of his army columns moved on Madrid, the general referred to his militant supporters within the capital as his "fifth column," intent on undermining the Republican government from within (see also Siege of Madrid (1936-39)).\n\nThe term is also used in reference to a population who are assumed to have loyalties to countries other than the one in which they reside, or who support some other nation in war efforts against the country they live in, which make them traitors.\n\nDuring World War II, German minority organizations in Poland and Czechoslovakia formed the Selbstschutz, which actively helped the Third Reich in conquering those nations and engaged in atrocities. The French Underground is a particularly well-known fifth column.\n\nDuring wars, citizens of enemy countries are often held or watched because of concerns that they might be a fifth column. During World War II, enemy aliens and citizens descended from immigrants from enemy countries were interned throughout Allied and Axis countries, from Japan and Japanese-occupied territories such as the Philippines, to India, Canada and Latin America. This was the justification for the Japanese American internment along the West Coast of the United States and the Japanese Canadian internment in British Columbia, Canada. Selected German and other nationals were also held by various US authorities. Irish Catholic residents in the UK have been sometimes viewed in this way by unionists due to "The Troubles" of the late 20th century (see also Guildford Four, Birmingham Six). Recently many Israelis have begun to suggest that Arab citizens of the state constitue a fifth column, citing terrorist-supporting activity by Arab members of parliament (illegal meetings with Hamas terrorists, fundraising, etc.) and not infrequent demonstrations held in Israeli Arab cities in support of Palestinian terror. The recent Israel-Hizbullah war gave Israeli Jews another reason for concern when Israeli Arabs openly supported Hizbullah even as their own cities in northern Israel were being bombed by the Lebanese group.\n\nToday it has a pejorative connotation, whereas partisan can be considered a positive or negative term. Resistance movements are looked upon more favourably than fifth columnists, but it can be argued that there is an overlap between the two.
4	what are the function of the mouse? The function of a mouse on a computer is to ease the task of moving the cursor around on-screen in a graphical environment; it also allows for the selection and activation of various functions that are presented on-screen.\n\nA computer mouse may also have various other functions, such as scrolling up and down or side to side in a window that is larger than the screen (with a wheel that may be built-in), selecting items for copying into the computer's memory, etc.
9	When the Postal Service raises Mailing rates? Why should you have to buy a 2 cent stamp just to mail a envelope ! I hate that They should honor all old stamps as 1st Class ! is it our fault they printed too many ? The US Postal Service is always running at a loss.  They have to try to cut that loss, so we're stuck with buying 2 cent stamps.  Anywho, many companies, ie. credit card companies, will pay for the missing postage when it's addressed to them.  That's how my husband and I went for months without even realizing the rate had been changed.

4	how to lock the system in linux? helo,i need to activate locking of he system when i'm not at the desk..\nhow do i go about doin this in linux!! In KDE, you can add a lock applet to Kicker, or simply choose to lock from the KMenu. I'd presume a similar applet exists for Gnome.\n\nXScreensaver usually handles locking, so an alternative would be to turn on the screen saver password, and set a mouse-activation corner for your saver.
4	Got a computer with "SUSE LINUX 9.2" operating system.  I'm a Windows brat; how do I use linux???????????????? The computer is from a family friend who quit his job cuz his wife and kids left him.

So im stuck with a relatively capable machine that I think is totally retarded and risky, because I dont know a lick about LINUX and require someone with in depth skill to rescue me...IM A WINDOWS BRAT!!!  but i have always heard that linux is a superior and safer way to operate a computer that is not Macintosh...something about its lack of background programs, and how its using minimal system resources, or somthing...PLEASE HELP ME WORK THIS AMAZING MACHINE!!!  It's like exxon sold me a tanker vessel, gave me the keys, and said "Have fun!  Whatchout, she's a bit hard to stop..." and left me alone with no crew to operate the vessel...give me the crew to operate this confusing vessel!!! Give me the knowledge and power of Linux!!!!! Linux is a very good operating system, i recommend using Gnome gui. its easy to use. The best place for any help with linux is the net. Most any linux formus have many people that have no problems helping out someone who wants to learn linux. Linux.org has linux 101 online classes for free to teach about linux.
0	stigmata???? for the unbelieving secular humanists...please explain people who get the wounds of christ. (i am not saying it happens often...but it does indeed occur). can you explain this without any BS (and i am a very good bs detector). just another piece of evidence if u ask me. I don't know that anyone really understands it but I agree  that it allegedly happens. I understand that St Francis of Assisi  experienced wounds on his hand, feet, and his side on his death bed.  Can ones mind be so powerful that it can cause physical changes whether that be wounds or illnesses, I don't know.   Many in the medical profession say so, and that's why they say some people experience psychosomatic illness.....you think you're ill so you become that way.  You might check out a little book called "As a man Thinketh" by James Allen.  If you consider this BS, I apologize.

He really likes you but he also sees that you like his friend. He is not sure about your feelings and he plays games so as to understand what happens. If you reassure him, that you now feel nothing abou his friend, you give him the ''green light'' to move on. He also hesitates to talk about his feekings, because he has a girlfriend. This mean that his first prioority is to do something with his relationship. Maybe he is not sure if he wants to break up with his girlfriend! The only thing you have to do is tell him that YOU NO MORE LIKE HIS FRIEND. Then, you will understand by his moves if he really likes you or not!

1	what is the lewis dot structure for ClO2? Count the number of valence electrons in each atom, and add them up. Cl = 7, O = 6, so total is 19. Chlorite (ClO2-) is an ion with a minus 1 charge, so add another electron to the count for that extra one. 20 total.\n\nNow, arrange the atoms and draw in bonds until each atom has a full octet.\n\nO-Cl-O with six dots around each O, and four dots around the Cl.\n\nThe formal charge on this molecule works out fairly nicely too, but if you haven't gotten to formal charges yet, then don't worry about it.

Only a little bit.\nIf you select your writing instrument, paper and the surface on which you will plca the paper in such a way that friction is minimal then it will help.\nSimilarly using a lighter pencil as compared to a heavier one will also help.
6	are there any philanthropists left in the U.S. that desire to help those in need of urgent financial assis.? this is not a hoax or a joke. i've heard that philanthropists exist, but am having trouble finding them. i am a hard-working us citizen who just needs a little help. i am a teacher struggling to make ends meet with one child. our summer school session has been cancelled and the funding for the program i teach was cut short, and has left me unemployed 2 weeks prior than originally expected. i am law-abiding, always helping others, yet find myself in a position of needing help. if anyone has an answer that may help me, i would greatly appreciate it. i only ask that sarcasm and judgemental responses be left out. please. i am a good person, a good mother, and i love being a positive influence to my students. if there is anyone out there who is able to help, i am willing to go through any process to prove my character and background. thank you for reading and responding. There are many rich people out there who want to help poor people.  But I have never heard of any rich person that individuals can write to for money.  Rich people usually donate to organizations, and these organizations help mostly people in desperate circumstances, who are staving or homeless or owing hundreds of thousands in doctor bills for their kids.  I don't think there is any organization that gives money to people like you. \n\nIf you need help, you can contact food banks in your area or talk to people at your place of worship.  Consider getting a loan, if possible.  \n\nPlease don't spend much time trying to hunt for these mythical "philanthropists".  They don't exist.
8	Should you be friends with someone ...? that your friend wants to date. If a  friend meets a guy at a party that she has fallen head of heels in love with and introduced you to him the next day for your opinion. Is it wrong for one to be independently friends with this guy as in having NO romantic interest in him but as you live 10 miles apart in a sleepy town and get on very well that you meet up for the odd drink or two. Is this being disloyal to the friend even if you think the friend may not like it. Said friend lives about 100 miles away from the boy bu the does seem interested in her even though has suggested meeting up with her friend to hang out. I would tell your friend that you and him are friends. Be honest. Don't keep anything away from your friend. No guy is more important than your friend.

6	Can we have an IRA account while in SSI? and if so what do we have to do? You cannot contribute to an IRA based on income from SSI alone. If that is your sole income, you need to look into other savings vehicles for your retirement, such as mutual funds or annuities. \nHowever, if you are married and your spouse works, he or she may be able to contribute to your IRA. I'll send you the link to a good calculator that will help you figure out how much you can contribute. It's going to depend on income, age, and how much your spouse contributes to their own plans. \nIf you need further help with this, let me know. You can e-mail me through Y!Answers. I"m glad to help :)

9	Should we abstain from punishing criminals if they have been committing crimes for at least 2 years? I think maybe we should reward experience. If they don't have at least 2 years experience in crime, they should be punished. Likewise, if they have at least 2 years experience they should get off scot free and maybe even be rewarded for their cunning abilities.\n\nBTW, If you think I am crazy, watch out cause I have George Bush on my side. I am currently working in the field of parole and probation and I would definitely say NO!  Keep in jail and teach them a thing or to there that they could use outside.  You can't reward bad behavior!

9	Is there a site that I can obtain free legal advice? I have googled it but it seems there are a lot with hidden costs. Websites are NOT good places for "free legal advice."  The  rules of ethics that govern attorneys in the U.S. severely restrict the types of "advice" that may be posted on a website.  Attorneys cannot offer "advice" without accepting someone as their client, running a conflict of interest check, and establishing a relationship that allows the attorney to fully understand the issues and facts underlying a person's problem.\n\nIf you just need general information, oftentimes, there will be articles or resources posted by particular institutions or non-profits based on topic area.  Need to know about whether a student can sue a teacher for yelling at him in a classroom? Try firstamendmentcenter.org. You get the point.  In addition, you can always call your local bar association.  They will provide you with a reference for attorneys with areas of knowledge that you may contact.  Often, these attorneys may see you at an initial consultation with no fee.

1	A tough word problem for wise people!? A circular braided rug just fits a square room with sides of 16 ft.\nWhen the rug is in place, how much of the old floor will show?\n\nHere is the answer, 55 sqft. \nbut proof it. If it JUST FITS the room, diamter of the circle (the rug) is equal to the side of square room that is 16 ft.\n\nso the area of circle (rug) is pi*8*8 (pi*r2) the radius is half the diameter.\n\n200.96 sq ft.\n\nAnd the area of the floor is side2 (coz its a square) thus area = 16*16 = 256 sq ft.\n\nSo the are of the floor is area of room - area of rug = 256 - 200.96 = 55.04 sq ft !!! thats the answer. 10 pts please. I hope i'm the first.

1	how are foundations for bridges stuck on the river beds? I mean in the water, how is the concrete poured , if it's always wet There are many ways to do this. \n\n1. Engineers pour the concrete into metal forms, and remove the forms when the concrete dries.\n\n2. Another way is to temporarily divert the whole river through a side channel or tunnel, but I think this is usually done only when they want to build a dam across it.\n\n3. They can put a temporary barrier across a part of the river to build the foundations there, then build another temporary barrier across a different part of the river to build the next foundations, and so on till all the foundations are build.  \n\n4. Some rivers flow seasonally, so they just wait till it is not flowing to build the bridge.

5	How do pro cyclists get an average speed of 40Kph. When I cycle its tough to maintain 30Kph? They've been doing it for a long time, and most likely focused on their training much more intensely and specifically than the average person. They now train with power meters and heart rate monitors, as well as doing specific testing with coaches and doctors to optimize their performance.\n\nMaximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and Lactate Threshold (LT) are the things the pros work on religiously. Natural ability/genetics have some say in things, but LT is highly trainable.\n\n40 kph isn't all that fast for the pros. When riding in the pack, riders benefit from the drafting effect, saving up to 30-40% of the  effort of the riders taking the full brunt of the wind. The professional peloton can cruise along at well over 40 kph for hours on end.\n\nIn individual time trials (albeit the effort isn't necessarily long, per se), average speeds of over 50 kph have been recorded. Sprinters can get the speed up to over 70 kph in a finale of a race. The same can be said for track sprinters (the fastest kilo ever done was clocked at just under one minute, and that's from a standing start).\n\nTheir bikes, especially their time trial bikes, helmets and clothing, have all been designed to minimize drag and save time. Teams now regularly use wind tunnels to test equipment and fine tune riders' positions to further help in this endeavor.\n\nAnd yes, riders do dope up. Whether it's steroids, EPO (red blood cell producing drug), or blood doping (transfusion of blood into the rider's system) it's an ugly side of the sport that is a very real problem. It'll make riders fast, but it also puts their health at risk.\n\nThe theory is that blood doping or EPO makes more red blood cells. Red blood cells are what transport oxygen throughout the body. So the thought is that more is better. The only problem is that it also makes the blood thicker. When EPO started showing up in the early 90s, riders were dying in their sleep from heart attacks brought on by the thickened blood. One abused it so much that he said that he'd have to take an aspirin every night before going to bed to thin out his blood.

4	I just got a dell loptop and i need to get internet service, i already have a rooter what is the next step? congratulations on your laptop.  Having your own laptop is fun.  Finding internet access is easy:  a good source is looking in the yellow pages (if you are in the USA) for internet provider listings.  A lot are advertised on the TV and have 800 numbers to call, some are offered by the phone company such as AT&T ; AOL; Earthlink, Netzero, Yahoo, Peoplepc, etc.   You will need a basic server:  most come preloaded on the laptop--mind did and it is Microsoft Internet Explorer.   You need a server to get on the internet and then one of the on-line providers listed above.  I am not sure of what you would do if you are from a country other than the USa, BUT Dell could let you know what is available where you are.   Best wishes
9	What demonstrated enforcement for the monroe doctrine? The choices are:\n1) The US convinced Japan to open trade relations\n\n2) The US allowed hawiians to import sugar duty free\n\n3) The US insisted that great britain submit a boundary dispute with venezuela\n\n4) The US competed against france and britain for asian markets\n\nPlease have proof of your answer. Primarily, #3 epitomizes the doctrine.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine states three major ideas, with one more added by President Theodore Roosevelt. First, it conveys that European countries cannot colonize in any of the Americas: North, Central, or South. Second, it enforces Washington's rule of foreign policy, in which the U.S. will only be involved in European affairs if America's rights are disturbed. Third, the U.S. will consider any attempt at colonization a threat to its national security. Roosevelt added to the doctrine, and summed up his additions with the statement, "Speak softly and carry a big stick."\n\nThe border dispute with Venezuela would have essentially grown British holdings in South America, thus breaking the primary tenant of the doctrine >> European countries cannot colonize in any of the Americas: North, Central, or South.\n\nBut more deeply seeded and self-serving plans were behind the creation of the Monroe Doctrine...\n\nThe end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 marked the breakup of the Spanish empire in the New World. Between 1815 and 1822 Jose de San Martin led Argentina to independence, while Bernardo O'Higgins in Chile and Simon Bolivar in Venezuela guided their countries out of colonialism. The new republics sought -- and expected -- recognition by the United States, and many Americans endorsed that idea.\n\nBut President James Monroe and his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, were not willing to risk war for nations they did not know would survive. From their point of view, as long as the other European powers did not intervene, the government of the United States could just let Spain and her rebellious colonies fight it out.\n\nGreat Britain was torn between monarchical principle and a desire for new markets; South America as a whole constituted, at the time, a much larger market for English goods than the United States. When Russia and France proposed that England join in helping Spain regain her New World colonies, Great Britain vetoed the idea.\n\nThe United States was also negotiating with Spain to purchase the Floridas, and once that treaty was ratified, the Monroe administration began to extend recognition to the new Latin American republics -- Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico were all recognized in 1822.\n\nSo the dispute over the Venezuelan border was truthfully the best example of enforcement, as we (and the British) tacitly supported the Bolivarian movement in Venezuela. So we publicly chastised Britain t give them an image of compliance while, gaining their support of the doctrine against France, Russia and Spain... giving us and the British free reign over the commercial markets.

1	When will Earth run out of Fresh Water? About 70% of the world-wide usage of water is in irrigation. Another 15% is industrial usage, like being used as a coolant in power plants. Another 15% is used by households. It is estimated that by the year 2025 much of the world will be facing a water shortage crisis.\n\nAlso when water evaporates over the oceans, like a hurricane or tropical storm, and then hits land it dumps freshwater on land that started out as saltwater. Also when a person drinks water all day they still excrete a substance that is 90% water, animals too, maybe half the amount or more that he or she drank.\n\nI am being misunderstood. The USA and Europe and Russia, according to the picture at the link, will not run out of water. It's places in the middleast and Africa that will be suffering from a water shortage crisis. The water will still be on the planet, they just won't have any to drink. The water won't be able to get there. Thank you to the person two boxes up that pointed out this answer could be misunderstood.

If she has pic's all over the place she either just coincidental has his last name and is just abnormally obsessed--in which case you should ask her because I'd imagine she'd be extremely excited to tell someone of her fan worshiping. And if she really is related, then still ask her. You could say she resembles him and you just wanted to know.

Personally, I like Rod Stewart's version of What a Wonderful World.\n\nPlease, none of those emo songs. Ian Hunter - Is There Life After Death\nNeil Young - Tonight's The Night\nBob Dylan - Death Is Not The End\nLed Zep - In My Time Of Dying\nVelvet Underground - Heroin\n(BTW, What A Wonderful World has absolutely nothing to do with death...it's a love song. Maybe you didn't ask the question properly.)

8	Is it bad to talk to your ex fiance'...........? We ended out engagement about 11 months ago....were engaged for 2 years, and together for 5.........I have a guy, he has a new girl, but he always calls me and tells me how much he misses me and loves me, and will never love anyone else like he does me!  I NEVER innitiate these conversations, and dont call him!  He is always the one doing the calling......we have not seen each other since it ended, and we dont have any financial ties, or any children together!  What should I think about all of this....... His affection is nice, but I can see it's unwanted. It must be hard for him to move on after a long relationship like that. It's not bad to keep talking to him, but if he's being pushy about getting back together you need to say something about it. Especially since you have a new guy and he's with someone else. He needs to focus on that new relationship before she finds out that hes still focused on you.

The history of Tution,What is the history of Tution in developing countries,What is the history of Tution in developed countries,Advantages & disadvantages of Tution classes 25 years ago when I was in school we used to feel ashamed to go to a tuition.  Only those who were not intelligent are those who took up tuitions.\n\nNow it is the other way round.  One reason I personally identify for this is the spread of notion that education is  business i.e. commercialisation of education.\n\nSince a number of revenue streams are to be evolved (just like in any business) they created a number of different routes, terms, courses to mint money.\n\nIt is a pity that a student is less (far far less) aware/knowledgeable than a student at the same age (25 years ago)..\n\nIs this development??????????\n\nhttp://www.futureaccountant.com/\nhttp://www.schoolingkids.com/

3	Thoughts about Speed Mathematics, speed reading, perfect pitch.? Genius?\nPractice?\nAttainable?\nGift of Birth?\n\nWhat do these mean to you?\n\n\nNo teen self proclaimed genius bragging. I want to hear logic and methodology. These are just my opinions.\n\nSpeed Mathematics - I think it's something you are born with. Can you practice and get faster? Yes, but never to the level of the geniuses that are born with it. \n\nSpeed Reading - Learned. I think that there are some people who are more apt at this kind of thing then others, but I think it's learned.\n\nPerfect Pitch - definitely you are born with it. There IS no learning perfect pitch (and that I know for a fact as I was a music major in college). You CAN learn to recognize and sing pitches that you want, but when you do, it is then called RELATIVE PITCH.

3	Who won the french and indian war? The war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763. The treaty resulted in France's loss of all its possessions in North America (all of Canada was ceded to Britain) except Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands off Newfoundland. France also kept the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique because of their rich sugar crops and the ease with which it could be controlled. Spain gained Louisiana in compensation for its loss of Florida to the British.\n\nOne result of the war was that Britain gained control of a strip of territory along the St. Lawrence River that now forms part of the Province of Quebec with approximately 54,000 French-speaking, Roman Catholic population. Near the beginning of the war, in 1755, the British had expelled French-speaking populations in Acadia to Louisiana, creating the Cajun population, but this would not be repeated in 1763.\n\nThe European theater of the war was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on February 15, 1763.
0	Why do all questions that I post in religion and Christianity get erased? People are so incredibly lame.  They can't handle a little skepticism or doubt.  They automatically feel like they need to jump all over everyone who says anything that could be twisted and misconstrued to mean that they don't have faith in God.\n\nIf you can't question your faith, then how do you know the depth of your belief? I say question away....by questioning your own belief system, you'll either confirm for yourself what you already believe or shift your beliefs based on your findings.  As long as you, yourself, respect others and their opinions I wouldn't worry about others being "lame".  :-)

Hopefully thats a very long time from now, here, but in just a blink of an eye where she is now.\n\nI wish you all the blessings that God can give !!! I would like to share this quote with you .. I think it's so true.\n\nDeath is no more than passing from one room into another. But there's a difference for me, you know. Because in that other room I shall be able to see. \nHelen Keller
2	Do oral "waterpick" products really work at dental/gum problems, or are they more hype? They really do work! They stimulate the gum tissue and toughen it against periodontal disease, and they are also excellent for removing food particles. Try it- brush your teeth, then use a water pick. You'll see the food it dislodges. One tip- when you first begin, use a very gentle setting, or else you can cause gum injury/bleeding. As your gums strengthen, you can increase the pressure.

0	Why do so many people believe that homosexuality is a psychological disease? It was removed from the American Psychiatric Association's list in 1973. So why do people consider it a mental disease? Because people are close-minded and can't believe that some people are born loving people of the same sex, just like themselves are born loving people of the opposite sex.  It is shown throughout the animal kingdom that homosexuality is not just a human thing, but something that many animals partake in.\nI don't see why it matters to so many people anyway.  I mean, why do they care if loving someone of the same sex makes someone else happy.  Worry about your own happiness.\nTo each his/her own.\n:)

2	What can be done to stop hiccups? Hiccups are gulping sounds caused by involuntary spasms of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen and helps with breathing. Hiccups can be triggered if you eat too much or too fast, consume very hot or cold foods and beverages, or drink carbonated beverages. Other causes include cold showers, entering or leaving a hot or cold room, sudden excitement, and stress. \nHiccups are not a serious medical condition and usually disappear on their own within a few minutes. If they last longer than 24 hours, hiccups may be a sign of another condition or injury. You should see your health care provider if you experience prolonged hiccuping. \n\nHome remedies are usually the primary treatment for hiccups, although no one is really sure how well they work. Hiccup home remedies include sneezing, being suddenly frightened, holding your breath, gargling, drinking pineapple juice, drinking water rapidly, sipping ice water, or swallowing dry granulated sugar. These activities may help by altering breathing patterns.

3	7/10 divided by 2 1/3? Step 1:  Change the mixed number to an improper fraction\n  7/10 divided by 7/3\n\nStep 2:  Change the division to multiplication\n  7/10 multiplied by 7/3\n\nStep 3:  Flip the second fraction\n  7/10 multiplied by 3/7\n\nStep 4:  Solve by multiplying across (numerator times numerator and then denominator times denominator)\n\nIf you can get that far then you're good.  But from there you will have to reduce and go from there.
0	For Muslims: Is Islam a religion of Peace or Jihad? After Sept 11, 2001,  President George Bush stated that Islam is a religion peace that had been hijacked by a violent few.  Is he wrong?\n\nBut with recent elections of Hamas, a terrorist organization, and the and Arab media like Al-Jazzera giving Al-Queda a prominent voice what is a person to think.  \n\nIs the democratic election of Hamas, proof that the majority muslims believe in jihad or terrorism.\n\nWhere is the moderate Muslim voice that condems these groups and promotes the religion of peace? what is the definition of terrorism? \n\nto be even more fair, both hamas and Israel need to be condemned. how come when Innocent people die from the palastians side then Israel is no blame, but when Innocent people die in Israel then all jump on the poor palastians? \nmurder is murder even if that person is blowing himself up, or carry a advance technological weapons shooting people. \n\nMuhammad has clearly forbid killing your own self and he said whoever killed himself is in Hell forever. also in the Quran it mentioned whoever kill an inocent soul with no right it's like killing the whole people. also Muhammad forbid killing women and children even if they were from among the enemies.\n\nthe word Jihad mean struggle with own self to do good. Jihad dosen't always mean war and fight. Jihad-fight is only allow to defend your country against any unfair attack which is common sense, but muslims are not allowed to fight those who did not fight them, neither allowed to kill people who come for peace or inocent people. \n\nIslam is not about peace of jihad, islam is about fair and truth. Islam peaceful with those who are peaceful with it, and harsh on those who attacking them unfairly.\n\nand every muslim will be questioned infront of God of the behavior he has done. there is different between people behavior/culture and what-Islam-says.  you need to also count the psychological pressure on those people, social pressure, humiliation, no feeling of hope, people went thru bad exprience, people loose their love ones and want revenge...etc all that create hate and hate create terrorism.

5	Who do you think has been the best quarterback of all time and why? I've been searching and I've came up with a lot of diferent answers, so I would like to know yours... Joe Montana without a question.... but as to the QB that was great and was the most fun to watch.... that was without a doubt FRAN TARKENTON.... the sheer terror and frustration you saw in defensivemen when he got even a little light of day was truly exciting.  You could almost feel opponents thinking , \n\nOH, f**K, am I going to look like sh*t on the postgame reels!!!\n.\nAnd he had relatively average offensive help around him most of his career.  (Some great defenses withe the Vikes though)\n.

Two out of 3 main parties have chosen new leaders recently & the next candidates for the top job for Labour & the Liberals are male.  \n\nHowever there are many excellent candidates further down the greasy pole and it seems likely that some of them will be challenging for the leadership role when Cameron & whoever succeeds Brown/Blair resigns.  You could then see 2 out of 3 major parties led by women.

3	In colleges or a university fraternity houses, are you tested to see if you are accepted as a resident ? Do they still have panty raids where a guy has to get the panty from the girl's dresser, her dirty laundry or off her while she's sleeping in order to belong to a fraternity? Every fraternity's rituals are different. That story is probably one fraternity's ritual. Other rituals may include stripping down to your boxers and enduring harassment of your peers, stealing University property to add it to the fraternity house. Its all different, just college guys doing stupid stuff. \n I'm not quite sure what your main question is though. \nTo join a fraternity at a college you must be attending that college, however I don't think its required that you live on campus or be a resident. Though you must be a student, thats for sure.

In a question about the nomination of Harriet Miers nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, Dean said ...\n\n"But in the this case, I think with a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, you can't play, you know, hide the salami, or whatever it's called."\n\nWhatever. Don't you think the Democrats could find somebody to lead the party who can frame a thought better than this?\n\nShouldn't mangling public speeking be reserved for Presidents? I thought the fact that he is Howard Dean was enough proof that he's a bad choice.
3	In the 16th Chapter of the book of Romans verse 22, it states that Tertius, was the one that wrote this Epistl From the New Kings James version, it states that Paul was the writer, who then is this other Person Tertius, or it his name just referred to as this person and it really means Paul Paul's scribe in the epistle to the Romans was Tertius, the date is AD 58. Paul is dictating a letter, in his room at the house of Gaius in the city of Corinth. He has been preaching in Corinth for some months, and has won many converts. For some time he has been planning to send a letter to a group of Christians in another city. Would Tertius be kind enough to come to the house of Gaius, some time this week and write a letter from Paul's dictation? Arriving at the house of Gaius, Tertius takes his seat at the writing table, stylus in hand. \nTertius is etching Paul's words on a papyrus sheet, one phrase at a time. Paul reclines on a couch, or perhaps in his enthusiastic manner walks back and forth across the room. While Tertius writes one clause, Paul thinks of the next. As he rapidly dictates the sentences, Tertius writes them down as fast as he can. He probably wrote the final copy of the letter in a "cursive" or running style of hand writing, which was different than the letters which were used in permanent books, just as our script is different than print. No spaces between the words in Tertius letter, and almost no punctuation marks.

4	I just got a dell loptop and i need to get internet service, i already have a rooter what is the next step? congratulations on your laptop.  Having your own laptop is fun.  Finding internet access is easy:  a good source is looking in the yellow pages (if you are in the USA) for internet provider listings.  A lot are advertised on the TV and have 800 numbers to call, some are offered by the phone company such as AT&T ; AOL; Earthlink, Netzero, Yahoo, Peoplepc, etc.   You will need a basic server:  most come preloaded on the laptop--mind did and it is Microsoft Internet Explorer.   You need a server to get on the internet and then one of the on-line providers listed above.  I am not sure of what you would do if you are from a country other than the USa, BUT Dell could let you know what is available where you are.   Best wishes

8	what's your opinion on this relationship? I'm African and I have been dating an Indian guy who is 34yrs for 2 months now. He treats me so nice on all the dates we've had. Now he has started talking of marraige. I feel that being of a different race will not go down too well with his people so I'm planning to break up with him this weekend. This saddens me so much but what else can I do. What's your opinion? Also he is muslim but insists he isn't a religious person. Sometimes I wish we had never met He always treats you nice?  And now he's talking of marriage?  Just because the family doesn't like you (why should they, in this day and age.  And if they do, that doesn't have anything to do with him) doesn't mean you should break up!  If he asks you to marry him, and then the family expresses a dislike for you, deal with it then.  If he's willing to look past race, so should you be.  Don't worry about the family.  If they're reasonable, they will get past their prejudice, and if they aren't, you have him.  He will want you whether his family does or not. \nIf there is another reason you want to break up with him, think about that.  Why do you really want to break up with him?  And if it is because you're afraid the family won't like you, tell him!  Ask if they won't, and ask how that will affect your and his relationship.  If he feels its a problem, then marriage obviously isn't an option.  But if it isn't, then you can work things out with the family.\nLove will find a way!\nGive him a chance.  \nIf you disagree with his religion, get it out in the open.  If he insists he isnt religious, you need to think about how it will affect your relationship.  If you can't deal with that influence in your life, you need to seriously reconsider.\n"Sometimes I wish we had never met." Why?  What is it about him?  Is it his race, religion?  You say he is nice... but...\nIt really does seem like you're ready to break up, but these seem to be rather physical reasons.  Not very deep.  If you worry about these kinds of things now, are you really ready for marriage anyway?\nThese things you have to discuss with him.  Look deeper for the reasons you wish you'd never met.  I'll bet it's something more than your race or his family or religion.\nGood luck!
4	how do i access my documents from my laptop from another laptop? my computer says system32 is corrupt so im trying to access all my saved files in my computer. i dont have the xp cd, i only have the one that comes with my computer so it means i have to reinstall everything. can it be done using a usb connected to another computer? well, you might have to reinstall xp using the cd, but you can move all your documents from the old laptop in several ways. one way is to slave your HDD to the new laptop, which i believe you wouldn't have the right equipment at the moment. the other way is to burn your files from the old laptop on a cd, and copy them on the new laptop. the other way would be to zip all the files you want on the old laptop and email them to yourself, and download them on your new laptop. another way would be to use infrared or bluetooth if your laptops have them.\nshould i proceed or is this enough?
2	Has anyone out there used the drug "Phentermine"? I just started taking it today, I have 25 pounds to lose, I took 50 of it off after having my last child in the past two years and I am just looking to lose that last 25. I have friends who have used it and have lost alot. Anyone else get good results using it???? I'm on it now, but if you only have 25 lbs to lose, you don't need it.  It's a serious drug--DRUG--with side effects--including addiction. (I have one friend who is addicted.)  It's NOT for losing 25 lbs.  Were you checked out by a doctor first?  \nI've lost almost 40 lbs since February on it, but I'm morbidly obese. The drug was designed for people like me--not you.\nI wouldn't subject my body to insomnia, headaches, dry eyes, thirst, hot flashes and now withdrawal if I only had to lose 25 lbs.  \nBe careful, that's all I can say.

7	Most Haunted? I hate to admit it but I'm a big fan of the show. \n\nLast year it was revealed that Derek Acorah was a fake and this was re-affirmed with an interview in the Metro this week with Yvette Fielding who also expressed her disappointment.\n\nIs the show and the activities we see/hear fake or real? What do people think and has there been any proof or articles about it to prove/disprove it? I'm a huge fan too, and i do believe that what they get on tape is real, it interesting to point out that even Yevette who has been working on this show for years is not a fully converted believer. Derek's episodes of being possessed became more frequent and more OTT, his part was never what interested me i enjoy the orbs, noises and moving objects (like the drum on a table turning and sliding to the side at the same time .. That made me jump) The new mediums seem OK and not as 'show off' as Derek was. I still love the show no matter anyone else says.. it's a huge hit .

8	My daughters are going to come out in a wedding, they wiil be holdind the tail of the brides dress.? What are they called? Are they bridal girls? it's not common anymore - but in England, it used to be a tradition to have young boys and/or girls "carry" the train in formal weddings. This was generally because they were so long (think Princess Di). \n\nThey could be called page boys, bridal attendants, flower girls, etc. I did attend one wedding were this was done, and the wedidng had an angel theme, so the girls were called Angel Attendants and each wore a small pair of white angel wings.

6	Can we have an IRA account while in SSI? and if so what do we have to do? You cannot contribute to an IRA based on income from SSI alone. If that is your sole income, you need to look into other savings vehicles for your retirement, such as mutual funds or annuities. \nHowever, if you are married and your spouse works, he or she may be able to contribute to your IRA. I'll send you the link to a good calculator that will help you figure out how much you can contribute. It's going to depend on income, age, and how much your spouse contributes to their own plans. \nIf you need further help with this, let me know. You can e-mail me through Y!Answers. I"m glad to help :)

5	Isn't it time for Ronaldo of Brazil to retire from soccer? Maybe but come on people, give the guy a break. Every excuse under the sun is being offered for Brazil, the team's, performance V's Croatia, so maybe there is an underlying problem people are not aware of with him. So he is over  weight, he is not the only one. He gets paid an obscene amount of money to represent his country, he is not the only one. How quickly one falls from grace in the eyes and hearts of admirers after a bad display. I'm not a huge fan of him but certainly appreciate and respect his enormous talent. He deserves an opportunity to redeem himself. If he fails we will all have the answer.
2	Anybody heard anything about Byonetics therapy for Autism? Here's a link I found: http://autism.comingbackhome.org/\n\nIt looks like a wonderful, easy to administer therapy.  I am so excited I wanted to know what others might know about it. Thanks! Byonetics is something I had never heard of so I looked it up.  It sounds very interesting and there seems to be positive results from it.  I would say it certainly can't hurt.  I have a 23 year old daughter with Asperger's Syndrome, even though it is not full Autism we have had many trials and tribulations over the years. She was diagnosed at 16 years of age so the poor kid had to make it on her own in the regular school system.  She has grown to be the most beautiful young lady, but still is not what society would call fully "functional".  I wish there would have been anything that could have helped her while growing up, but with such a late discovery she had to make it on her own.  I have found something now that is helping her, wish I would have found it years ago!

4	Computer boot problem!? It doesnot happen often, but sometimes when i boot my computer, it freezes in midway. The mouse won't move. What might be the problem and the solution? problem is definately the hard disk.\nbad sectors must have developed on the storage media in the hard disk \nthis normally happens due to shutting off the pc directly or by cutting the power supply without going to "start" and turn off computer option. this reduces life of a harddisk.\nrun scan disk at startup to mark the bad sectors on the harddisk\nso that data is not stored in already marked bad sectors.
6	i payed a loan in full and on time but it has no credit value why? Always ask if the lender reports to a credit agency.  Also, make sure to ask exactly *what* kind of information they report.  There are a lot of lenders out there that will only report information to a credit agency that is negative.  So, for example, if you were late on a payment they would report that information but if you had paid the loan on time they would simply not report anything.

1	If my helicopter was crashing are my chances of survival improved if I jump onto the top of a building? I figure that if I'm falling from say ... 1200ft in the air and I'm picking up speed as I fall, my chances of surviving the crash woud be improved if I jumped out of my cockpit onto a roof that was 200ft off the ground as opposed to crashing at 0ft - ground level.\n\nI'm thinking that my accumulated cceleration would be less at 200ft above ground compared to the speed I'd be falling when I hit the ground at 0ft.\n\nPlus, I figure that if I jump in an upward motion out of the cockpit, the pull of gravity would counteract the acceleration of my upward jump and for a split moment "freeze" me in the air while it regained control of my body and pulled me back down to the rooftop.\n\nSo at 200ft, if I jump out and up 4ft into the air away from my crashing helicopter over a nearby rooftop; after being "frozen" in the air for a split second I'd only have a 4ft drop to the rooftop. I could survive a 4ft drop.\n\nSomebody tell me what I'm missing here, please. No, sorry, but your'e kind of off base with your logic.  \n\nFirst off, if you jump out of a crashing helicopter your odds of being killed are much greater.  A helicopter autorotates which acts like a parachute.  If you jump, it will be like jumping out of a plane without a parachute.  Second, if you jump upward from the cockpit of a falling helicopter, your head will be chopped off by the spinning blades.\n\nI remember a case where a guy was flying a helicopter and the engine stalled.  He paniced and jumped out at 300 feet.  He died instantly.  A few minutes later, the pilotless helicopter set down a few hundred feet beside him and only suffered minor damage.  The point being that he would have survived if he had stayed with his helicopter.
3	Do you say, "broken at the waist" or "broken by the waist"? Thanks in advance. Simple question for English native speakers. It would depend on the sense in which you were using it. It's not a common expression in English.  If you were describing the way a garment looked, say, a long white dress, broken at the waist by a pink sash.  If you were speaking of a  vessel, such as a vase, which was damaged at the narrowest point, it could be broken at the waist. It would not be used either way to describe  an anatomical break, I don't think. \nThe only way you could use "by the waist " would be to explain a shape altered by the waist.
8	My gf said she would  breakup with me if i dressed like a thug. Is that wrong? Ive been with my gf for about a month and a half. And yesterday we were chilling and i pointed to a guy that had on baggy jeans and like a 4xl shirt on. He was basicaly dressed like a thug. Anyway i asked her if she would still be with me if i started dressing like that tomorrow and she said no. And i told her that id still act the same way and i would still treat her like a queen, the only thing that would change would be my clothes, and she still said no she would break up with me because she despises thugs. So i got mad because eventhough i dress nicenow, i feel like if she cared about me then my clothes wouldnt matter. Not to mention the fact that i dont really like she way shes dressed now, because im use to girls dressing preppy and she shops at jc penny (dont ask me why). But i put that aside because i like her. I told her all of this but it didnt make a difference.Although she did say that she wouldnt know what to do because she hasnt been in a situation like that. get a life

3	is polish a hard language to learn? I don't know -- but very young Polish children seem to be able to do it. All kidding aside, it depends on how you do it. If you have an opportunity to associate with Polish people and put to use what you are learning, it will be much easier. Any language is hard to learn if you learn it in isolation and only use it in text book training.
6	How to multiply small amount of money fast. Where to invest ? what to do? I am looking for some great investing ideas which will multiply my small amout of money. Anybody who could help me out? you can get many answers on this one and i don't know how small the amount of money is you got. If it has to be fast like in a years time your options are the forex market, options and maybe small caps at the Nasdaq.\n\nThere's always risk involved with investing and trading but look at it from the bright side: your chances of succeeding - if you know what you're doing -  is 50/50 which is way, way much better than casino gambling and the lottery. With investing the odds seem to be somewhat better.\n\nFor trading and investing a must is that you're educated about the subject. Please avoid people who make promises, there is no such thing as promises or guarantees. If there's a catch then you know something is up. You increase your chances significantly if you develop an understanding of the market and the tools of the trade.\n\nSome might say investing is safer than trading, but this is rather relative since therea are also safe trading systems. Depends on how you look at it. Investing implies a long term strategy but the rewards are smaller while trading may have higher risks but the rewards are much larger. Risk is dependant on the individual and you therefore need to develop a trading system of your own if you want to grow your money fast with high leverage. Today online brokers have practice accounts available to learn the craft without risking a dime. I just hope you're not desperate and broke. Scared money rarely wins...\n\nIf in the end you rather invest than i can recommend stock funds with Fidelity and the Soros Quantum Fund. They've done very well in the past 20 years. I'm not so sure about mutual funds sicne i've heard several pro investors and brokers claim that those funds are in a waterfall pattern for the coming 10 to 20 years, in other words they will hardly be profitable...\n\nOn Friday 8th December, the NFP report is released and the USD always makes a large move at 8:30 am (NY time). A lot of people make lots of money in the forex with this news release, since they know that price almost always moves up with a currency pair like GBP/USD or EURUSD... trading the non-farm payroll is the fastest way of multiplying your money.... this is information not a recommendation.\n\nopen up a free gbpusd chart and be ready to watch it happen on friday the 8th....

I used Monistat 1 and the box says not to have sex while using the product, but is that just the day that you use it or the 3 days it is supposed to take to cure it?? monistat is good, but not great because it's messy after  using so it would be hard to tell if your infection is gone or not.  I suggest in the future u use DIFLUCAN it's a pill u must have a prescription for and it works MUCH BETTER AND FASTER than monistat 1,3 or 7.  To answer your question wait at least 7-10 days.....

7	Cinderella...? Cinderella is now 95 years old.\n\nAfter a fulfilling life with the now dead prince, she happily sits upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by from her front porch, with a cat named Bob for companionship.\n\nOne sunny afternoon out of nowhere, appeared the fairy godmother.\n\nCinderella said, "Fairy Godmother, what are you Doing here after all these years"?\n\nThe fairy godmother replied,\n"Cinderella, you have lived an exemplary life since I last saw you. Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?"\n\nCinderella was taken aback, overjoyed, and after some thoughtful consideration, she uttered her first wish:\n\n"The prince was wonderful, but not much of an investor.\nI'm living hand to mouth on my disability checks, and I wish I were wealthy beyond comprehension.\nInstantly her rocking chair turned into solid gold.\n\nCinderella said,\n"Ooh, thank you, Fairy Godmother"\n\nThe fairy godmother replied,\n"It is the least that I can do.\nWhat do you want for your second wish?"\n\nCinderella looked down at her frail body, and said,\n"I wish I were young and full of the beauty and youth I once had."\n\nAt once, her wish became reality, and her beautiful young visage returned. Cinderella felt stirrings inside of her that had been dormant for years.\n\nAnd then the fairy godmother spoke once more:\n"You have one more wish; what shall it be?"\n\nCinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and says, "I wish for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a kind and handsome young man."\nMagically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make-up that, when he stood before her, he was a man so beautiful the likes of him neither she nor the world had ever seen.\n\nThe fairy godmother said,\n"Congratulations, Cinderella, enjoy your new life."\n\nWith a blazing shock of bright blue electricity,\nthe fairy godmother was gone as suddenly as she appeared.\n\nFor a few eerie moments,\nBob and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes.\nCinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most beautiful, stunningly perfect man she had ever seen.\n\nThen Bob walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, & held her close in his young muscular arms.\n\nHe leaned in close, blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he whispered...\n\n"Bet you're sorry you neutered me." That is a great joke!

Did I screw up my workout by eating right after I finished exercising?\nThanks for your help. You didnt do your cholesterol levels any favours!

2	Is there an anti depressant that does not cause sexual dysfunction,such as inabilty to stay erect & ejaculate? I once tried wellbutrin and it did not work for me.I'm having diffuculty maintaining an erection and reaching orgasm. I'm currently taking Effexor Odd, because Wellbutrin is well known for its lesser tendency to have sexual side effects. Perhaps your dosage wasn't sufficient enough to control the depression (which, in turn, would have a significant effect on sexual function).\n\nStill, it is true that you need to find the right one that works for you. Just remember to make sure your doctor knows the effectiveness and side effects of your medications so he can work with you.

6	what are some clues that might indicate that an earthquake could soon occur along a particular fault segment? (science)pls answer this.. There can be some tremors that precede a quake.  This is called a foreshock sequence.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine a foreshock sequence until after the quake occurs.  There may also be surface disruption with land features being slightly twisted or misaligned.  In some rare instances, natural springs have stopped or started before a quake happened although this usually happens as a result of a quake.\n\nIn general, there is very little that we are aware of yet in terms of warning signs of a pending quake.

1	Why do we park on driveways, drive on park ways, and pay tolls on freeways? In the case of large estates, before we had suburbs, a driveway was the road that leads to the house from the public road. So you drive on it.\n\nHistorically, the term "parkway" has often implied that the road was designed specifically with a naturalistic or manicured landscaping of the median and adjacent land areas. Like a park.\n\nFreeways are named so because they have high speed limits and allow cars to move "freeeeely" without the burden of traffic lights or stop signs.\n\nSo that's why

5	what should india do to win 20 gold medals in olympics 2016? what should india do to win 20 gold medals in olympics 2016 pls say the answer b'coz i am a school girl in india so i want it and in 500 words pls help me They need to train with international coaches. India would need to spend massive amounts of money in order to lift its standard. Looking after the people should be a start. I would bet there are some from the lower regions (poverty I mean) that could compete very well given the chance. But to do that they need to be able to eat and train which they get no chance of.

0	i want to hear your opinions on heaven and hell whether you think its true or false? It will not be like most people believe. I think that many will be surprised to say the least. I think Hell will be living with the choices you made that prevent you from being in Gods presence and with your loved ones and the ones you care the most about. (REGRETS) Heaven will be a place of rest and continued learning.\nI lost my daughter and the pain of not having her in my life is horrible. I can't imagine spending eternity without her. See I know that with death I will see her again. The pain that I endure now will end with my death if I live the way I should and apply the atoning power of Jesus Christ into my life I can be forgiven and be with her and God again. To me that is what hell will be like. Being separated from all the ones we care about. and never at that point being able to change it.

1	How much power can we generate from piezoelectric crystals? Lets say we could attach one end of a piezoelectric substance to a musical tuning fork and the other to a fixed point, then we made the fork vibrate, it would make a voltage come out the piezo substance as a force is being applied.\nHow much energy  could be harvested from this (in Watts)? Lets all assume that the fork is vibrating at 440Hz (the first A above middle C in the musical scale). very little, because the current from pizo is very small,\nie: in   nano Amps,   and since  W= I  *  V \nfor example:     0.0000001 * 1000 = 0.0001 watts which is very little .\nso power input is more than power out put,  \nunless u have lots of free vibration and lots of cheap pizo to make it viable
9	Would you accept a job scrubbing toilets, picking vegetables or building houses in the hot sun?? If all legal and illegal immigrants had to return to their countries who will do the job some immigrants are willing to accept to put food on their table.?? There are plenty of people willing to do that stuff in this country.  Get the people off of welfare and get them to start picking the veggies.  Another problem is that the immigrants do those jobs and get paid little for thier hard work.  Personally I think they should allow who is already here to stay but make the law that anyone else will be deported.  People that are already here and have lives here should not be made to leave.\n\nP. S. I am available to pick veggies but I will not accept less than 8 dollars an hour.  That is hard work.
5	Who is going to win the OSU vs ND Fiesta Bowl Game? Notre Dame cannot stop the Ohio State offense.

0	Is religion an illusion created for poor people so they can have hope? Im asking about all religions, not one in particular One could say the same for advertising. Or sports. Or just about anything. \n\nPicking up religion, and examining every misuse of it is not the right way to look at religion. If a butterfly falls in your cup of coffee and make it undrinkable, would we conclude that butterflies were created to spoil coffee? \n\nButterflies do much more than die in cups of coffee, and coffee is rendered undrinkable for a hundred other reasons.\n\nThe point is, nitpicking on religion is not logical. I am not poor. Religion gives me hope too. That should kill this line of argument. \n\nReligion isn't something that people invented in the past 1500 years to kill each other. Religion is a way to understand life - the totality of life. There are many "problems" with applied religion, the biggest one is that people are selective in following religion, and then blame it all on faith.\n\nA writer once said that cultures are not based on customs. Cultures are different based on how people answer the question about life AND after life. In other words, how people answer the questions: WHO AM I? WHERE DID I COME FROM? WHAT AM I DOING HERE? WHERE WILL I GO WHEN I DIE? WHAT WILL HAPPEN THERE?\n\nTo me, that is also the definition of religion: a set of answers to the above questions. To apply such a big thing on individual examples is misunderstanding religion. Secondly, if people behave in this world as if there's no tomorrow, and someone else suffers from their acts - why blame it on any faith?\n\nReligion, esp Abrahamic faiths, are much much more than getting fascinated with nature. In Abrahamic tradition, that is just the beginning. Prophet Abraham started with observing nature, and was disappointed that the stars, moon, and the Sun all "vanished." So he said, "If this thing sets, it cannot be my God!" \n\nGod and religion are larger than people trying to use them as some kinds of solutions to everyday problems. Without changing the fundamental mindset - without answering these five questions above - one cannot understand and practice religion. And cannot blame the human faults on God.

2	How long before carbs turn into fat? I am curious on how long it takes after eating simple carbs such as cereal, rice , bread, for it to turn to fat if not used . Is it right away or does it take an hour or so of inactivity. Carbs don't "turn" into fat.  \n\nCarbs and all food are energy.  Your body only needs a certain amount of energy so if you eat more "energy" than you need, it gets stored as body fat.\n\nCarbs are used for energy before anything else.  Then protein, then dietary fat, then finally body fat.  If you eat too many carbs, then the protein & fat you're eating won't get used because they aren't needed.  If they aren't needed then your body won't use it's fat for energy because you already ate enough calories (energy).\n\nLook at it this way, if you weigh 200 pounds and need 2000 calories to stay that weight, then start eating 1000 calories your body will take 1000 calories from it's body fat to make up the difference.  \n\nYou need to use 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, so after 3 days you would lose 1 pound.\n\nUnless you did the Kimkins diet because it's thermogenic properties easily double that weight loss.

But it's possible. Good luck, I've sent many query letters.

Sounded like a sincere and reasonable comment he made to you.  If you took it as an accusation, I think you're just too touchy.

UCSC Slugmaster\n2 weeks ago\n\nReport Abuse\n Best Answer - Chosen By Voters\n\nif the system is so perfect why is evolution necessary?? and if you dont believe the man from monkeys thing, what about viruses and why we need new flu shots every year?? \n\n1 Votes   100% The system is a larger concept that we cannot at this point fully understand.  Think of the universe as a body, we are a small part that makes the whole function.  Just as cells in a body mature, some are created new, some are defective, all eventually die, just like we do.  Viruses evolve just like we do, they adapt because they are alive, just like us.  All things in nature adapt and change as time goes on, just as life does.  It's just one of those things we just need to accept and go on.
2	what do you do if you get aids? If I got aids, first of all, I would try to determine when I contracted it and contact all the people I may have infected. I would do this by retracing my steps so to speak. Go to the last person I put myself at risk with & backtrack until I get to someone who isn't infected & that would give me an idea who I contracted it from. I would still need to contact the people from before that though, just in case someone just got lucky & didn't get it from me. It's not gonna be easy & I would need to be ready for a few black eyes because if someone came to me and told me they may have given me aids I'd be tempted to give them the biggest beating of their entire life. I know it would be hypocritical of me for having put myself at risk but it's just human nature. Other than informing people and making sure I don't infect anyone else, there's not much else I can do. I would just need to make sure I keep myself healthy because the slightest infection would make me very ill.

9	Does anyone know where to get the actual process for U.S. immigration?? I'm writting a story on immigration and I want the real process...not just opinions of what the process should be...thanks so freaken much!! I can give you the general process. A U.S citizen can file an immigrant visa I-130 for his/her spouse, fiancee, children, son, daughter married and unmarried, parents, siblings. The I-130 petition is usually filed with the local BCIS (formerly INS) office. After approval this petition is forwarded to National Visa Center in New Hempshire. NVC completes certain requirements like Affidavit of support from the petitioner.  After that the file is forwarded to the overseas U.S embassy or consulate having jusrisdiction over the place of beneficiary's place of residence.  The Embassy then calls in the beneficiary for an interview and reviews all the local documentation as well. If every thing is in order an immigrant visa is issued.\n\nA green card holder can also file an immigrant visa petititon but only for spouse, children, unmarried sons and daughter.\n\nNow there are two basic categories one is called Immediate relative category and other one is preference category.  Immediate relative categories are not governed by any quota and all the applicants filing are processed e.g. spouse, children under 21 and parents of U.S citizen. All other categories are governed by a quota set by the federal government for each country per year. For example when a green card holder files a petition for the spouse the waiting period in this category is approximately 4 years.\n\nTo obtain further information on cutoff priority dates for preference categories check the following link:\n\nhttp://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/bulletin/bulletin_1770.html

He generates feelings in me that no man has ever done.  I think of him day and night, and when I hear his voice, I get all tingly, fuzzy, and warm inside.  We have been discussing marriage, and I do want to spend the rest of my life with him but I am afraid The thing is why are you asking.  There should be no question in your heart as to the rest of your life.  If your heart really feels as thought his is the person for you then the rest of you will fall into place.  There should be no question.  I'm not saying no but maybe you need to spend more time with this person before you make a lifetime promise to another person.

Aren't some needs BASIC to all?\n\nAre you going to boycott companies that offer health insurance to non-Christians who worship idols? After all, idolatry is against the bible not so? What about companies that allow obese people to work there? Gluttony is against the bible not so? When does it end? When companies ONLY hire people from YOUR Christian sect who apply the bible as YOU do?\n\nWhen does it stop being about morality and start getting meanspirited? I think you're right. Most Christian boycotters are very selective in who they boycott. Homosexuality is one "hot spot."\n\nTo be honest, if they boycott every company that had a disagreement with their theology, they couldn't buy anything at all. They should be living somewhere in hovels, without power, clothes, and food.\n\nIn any case, our job is to be salt in the world, not constantly protest what the world is doing.\n\nIf they are so worried about homosexuality, they would do much better being friends with homosexuals, finding out their needs, and serving them as real people whom they cared about, instead of impersonally fighting to simply take things away from them that they really do need.

4	pat/nat translations? when they are used There is a common misconception about PAT and NAT.\n\nPAT\nThis is a many to one solution. In this situation you have multiple machines talking to one firewall and then the firewall talks to the destination machine with your information but with the firewall as the return address. The firewall then receives the information the passes it on to you with the received IP being the orginal distant end.\n\nNAT\nWith NAT you need to have multiple ARIN routable IPs assigned to the public side of the firewall. This allows your private IPs to pick up a public firewall IP and hold on to it when talking. This is what many companies do to protect their webservers. When they have multiple inside webservers with multiple inside IPs they program the firewall to point one outside IP to a specific inside IP.\n\nMost home routers from linksys and dlink use PAT but they just call it NAT since this is how everyone knows it.

1	How do you average out your salary to figure out what you would've been if you were getting paid per hour? You have to divide the salary by the number of hours worked to earn it. That's the only way!\n\nIf you get paid $4000 a month and you work 40 hours a week you have worked an AVERAGE of 173.33 hours per month (40 hours/week times 52 weeks per year divided by 12 months), depending on your exact pay period. Thus you would be making  a little more than $23 an hour.\n\nThe 2080 quoted by Zandelia is just 40 hours per week times 52 weeks in a year or the number of hours worked in a standard year. However, as other people pointed out, you might work more than 40 hours weekly on salary... or LESS. What ever the number of hours worked in a pay period, divide the pay for that  period by the hours to get the answer!

1	Are you for or against stem cell research for a cure for cancer and why? The reason I am asking this is because I am writing a research paper for college on the topic.  I am a Catholic and also conservative (normally against stem cell research) but my mother had cancer when I was younger so of course if she didn't have to go through what she did I should love the idea.  I was just wondering other people's opinions as a sort of "poll" type-source, unscholarly of course. I am definately for research to cure cancer.  Like you, I watched someone very dear to me suffer from cancer.  I think that anyone who has ever had to watch anyone suffer and die from something so aweful wants to find a cure for it.  Stem cell research isn't killing babies- it's taking fertilized eggs, that would otherwise be thrown out, and creating cell lines so that different effects of hormones, etc can be determined.  The possibilities of stem cell research are so high right now, I think it would be foolish to not look into it.  \nBy the way, good for you for having your own beliefs.  It's so easy to have political or religious beliefs and just follow the crowd.  It takes guts to go against the norm of your party and stand up for what you think is right.

8	Am I being used? For people with a similar experience. I recently dated this girl who has a beautiful baby girl. The baby is not mine, but I would love her as if she was. This girl was dumped by her x when he found out that she was pregnant. I met her at a friends house and we hit it off. She would invite me around regularly to visit her at her house and we had a great time just me, her and her baby. We laughed joked and had fun. Then her landlord decided to sell the place and she needed to move out. She does'nt have a car so she got a lift to work with a freind. Her freind could no longer offer her the lift service because she had moved in with her best freinds parents. I then offered to take her to work and drop the baby off at the sitters she accepted. Once she was in her new reidence it became very hard for to see her again. I saw her for ten min in the morning while drivingand ten min at night when I dropped her off. when I asked her to do something with me she brushed it off.\n\nIs she using me ? I think that she may be using you....and maybe she feels guilty thats whys shes brushing you off. Sorry buddy but say you cant drive her to work anymore unless she starts paying you gas....but say you would like to see her otherwise. See what she says once the tables are turned.
1	Is it possible to distinguish you if the characteristics by which you are distinguishable from others vary? Taken from invariantology Yes. Even though they change, they are still distinguishing. You can recognise someone as long as you are familiar with their current distinguishing characteristics. This is the effect of not recognising someone you haven't seen for a while the first time you see them, but recognising them immediately the next time you see them.

What is letting on? Why is it important in this chapter?\n\nIf anyone can help, I would appreciate it. Thanks! \n\nPs. I've already looked on SparkNotes. this chapter is important because it shows a different side to Huck, he starts to look at jim as a normal human being instead of a "nigga".  This is when he has a battle within himself, between what he was taught by the widow and what he has learned from experience during his journey.

3	Masters and PhD? I have heard that once people have gained thier BS/BA etc at their choosen university, they then choose to goto another university to complete thier Masters and PhD, Why do people not stay with the chosen university that you completed BS/BA and do your MS/MA and PhD etc? Sometimes people do this, but it is generally regarded as a bad idea. People who are intending to have careers in the academic world are expected to have training from many different viewpoints, and you can't get different viewpoints if you stay at one place. Unless the place where you studied was undeniably the very best place for that subject, it would be regarded as a negative for you to stay in one place.

5	how can i increase my bench press so i won't get made fun of in the weightroom by my teammates? i want to know do i need to go to the gym or can i jus use the weights in my basement If you've got a bench press in your basement, work on that until you feel comfortable. The first thing you need to do is figure out what weight you max out at (the absolute most you can lift 1 time). Once you've figured that out, your bench workout should be 3-4 sets. \nSet 1) 6 reps of 75% of your max\nSet 2) 6 reps of 80% of your max \nSet 3) 5-6 reps of 85% of your max\nSet 4) 4-5 reps of 85% of your max\nObviously, make sure you have someone spotting you while you do this, because it's not going to be easy, especially the first few times you do it. DO NOT do this two days in a row...make sure you have at least one day off in between so your muscles have time to recover. If the 4th set it too much, then just do the first three. The sets should be difficult, but if they are too much, drop the %'s down by 5%. I'm not a trainer or anything, I just used to lift for football and that's approximately the plan they had us use. Hope it helps.
1	Why do ants touch each others antennas as they pass by each other? Like many other insects, the body of an army ant has a head, thorax and abdomen. The head has a mouth, eyes and antennae. The mouth has two jaws called mandibles that are like scissors. Still, army ants can only swallow liquids because the solids form a ball that the ant spits out. Unlike other ants, army ants do not have compound eyes, but instead have single eyes (but they are still blind). Army ants use their antennae to sense smell and touch. This is how they know which colony and nest they belong to. They use their antennae to communicate as well. The thorax is connected to the head by joints called nodes. The thorax is between the head and abdomen. It is connected to the abdomen by a narrow waist called the petiole. The abdomen is in the shape of an oval. That is where the stomach, large intestine, sting, etc. are located.
9	What % of people indicted by grand juries actually go to trial? I am more interested in the percentages stemming from "local" grand juries, not federal grand juries. I would suspect that the number approaches 100%.  Once an intictment has been handed down, it must be handled somehow.  Usually that's at trial.  Even if the case is plead out, there will be a hearing where the guilty plea is accepted and sentence passed.\n\nThe state could dismiss the charges but that would be unusual.  Some states invoke double jeopardy protections at that point if the case dismisses the charges.

9	What criteria should be satisfied before one country declares war on another?

3	How do I teach my brother to ride bike before summer vacation? He's 11 years old and no one ever has time to teach him so I feel responsible to do so. He knows the basics as far as brakes and he's learning to push off. Anything to help his balance or others? My little brother learned by starting with training wheels, but here's what we did a little differently.  As soon as he started showing some confidence, we bent the arms of the training wheels so that the bike could lean a little farther over before the wheels made contact with the ground.  Then, when we was confident with that, we removed one of the training wheels altogether, until in the end, he really didn't need them anymore.  It was a progressive way to give him less and less support but still the illusion of a safety net.\n\nHope this helps.

Any sudden chest pain needs to be evaluated URGENTLY.  One does not self diagnose major disease, even with the ertswhile assistance of Yahoo Ask.\n\n  Only you can judge your own pain level.  If the pain increases as you take a deep breath it could be upper respitory, or it could be Heart.  You are not qualified to judge nor do I hear or see any MD responses.\n\n  Do not wait, see a doc.

7	Is a 50 foot drop enough to kill a person? Well, we're going hiking on this 50 foot cliff thing and i'm wondering what'll happen if some1 falls down the cliff. Yes. However it depends on what you hit at the bottom. If your head hits a rock, definitely. True story: A man parachuted from 5000 feet and his chutes didn't open. He landed feet first (must have been a really soft surface) and walked away. The only difference was that he was an inch and a half shorter.  So you just never know, but a fifty foot fall could kill you depending upon what you land on and how you land.

3	What are atlest 3 different people's point of views for logging/destroying the rainforest? I need to know for a project :] Most of the world's rainforest has already been destroyed.  After it is destroyed, it can never be re-created.  Therefore, any damage to the rainforest should be prohibited and punished most severely.  The eco-systems and the species of the rainforest generally cannot survive elsewhere.  It is the responsibility of humans to protect the forms of life which have been so egregiously damaged by human action.  Not one centimeter of rainforest should be subject to harm.

5	Ideas for making a fantasy football league more fun? I'm the commissioner of a fantasy football league that consists of 10 current and former coworkers and their spouses.  We had to do an autodraft since some people live far away now and that wasn't as much fun as our live drafts previously.  There's less smack talk and there was no trading this year and, of course, some people are already clearly out of it.  Our league is a great bunch of people but I'm afraid with it being less fun this year no one's going to want to play next year and we'll start to really lose touch with one another.  \n\nSo does anyone have any things they do or ideas (please keep them clean) to keep the leagues fun and keep a league together? One idea I used for my fantasy league is to do a "keeper" league. There are many variations for this; here's the one I used. Each team participates in the inital draft. Once the season finishes, each team can choose to retain up to 4 players. The rest get funneled into the draft for next year. For next year's draft, the teams will mandatorially draft the (up to) four they retained. The rest will be put into a new draft, etc. etc. Another way to make FF fun is to put a wager on it, such as a "March Madness" office pool, or something akin to that. Hope I could help.

Bush, at the annual Al Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, Oct. 19, 2000\n\nhttp://politicalhumor.about.com/library/blbushism-elite.htm The base is the richest 5% so most Americans do not fit. Junior has turned "We the People" into "We the corporations"
2	Why do all the girls want to be skinny?In the veeeery old dayz it wuz the otha way.? The world we are living in right now is the driving force.Young girls are inclined to reain slimmer as men are more attracted to slimer women. This is clearly demonstrated in the way men tend to get drawn to younger slimmer women after their wives have gone and had babies. \nThis doesn`t nessesarily mean that they love the young girls more but i tend to think that it is an indication of agility which means more fun!

8	Married guy flirting...? I don't mind the flirting - but sometimes he talks about how his wife bugs him.  I can't tell if it's meant to be just a conversation or if he's trying to take it beyond flirting.  I was wondering how I can find out, because if he wants more than flirting, I'm going to back off. You need to back off...although, I don't think you are doing anything to cause him to behave this way. It is no longer innocent flirting when he chooses to complain about his wife to the woman he flirts with...Keep a safe distance, I think he's trying to be a bit more than a flirt.

1	How do you dilute solutions? Say you have 10mL of water, .1 M HCl, and you want to make it into .08,.06...How? Dilution formula:  C1 x V1 = C2 x V2\n\nAs long as both concentrations (C) are the same unit and the volumes (V) are the same unit you can use that formula for any dilution.\n\nex.  How many mL' s of 0.1M HCl are need to make 10mL of 0.08M?\n\n C1= 0.1  V1 = x   C2= 0.08  V2 = 10 mL\n\n0.1x = (10)(0.08)\n     x = 0.8 mL\n\nSo, you would use 0.8 mL of the 0.1M HCl and add 9.2 mL of water to make 10 mL's of 0.08 M.

2	Anyone want to tell us if taking ecstasy helped them good or bad? If you experiemented with ecstasy, did it help or mess with your mind? Are you glad or regret taking it? There is no doubt that ecstasy feels good, but there is a price to pay. I work with drug addicts and they suffer from damaged immune systems, chills, fevers for no reason, depression, anxiety, infections, weight loss, memory loss, blurred vision because ecstasy stretches the eye muscles when they over-react to the drug, etc. Even 6 years after they stopped taking the drugs they experience these symptoms. Ecstasy messes your hormones around and damages the neurons in the brain and throws your brain chemicals out of balance. If you know of anyone who is suffering from these symptoms after using drugs, L-tyrosine capsules (a natural amino acid) helps to increase Dopamine in the brain (a natural chemical to help with depression and memory). It takes about 2 weeks to start working. It might help (but first speak to a doctor before taking supplements). People who used drugs lose their sharp thinking and don't feel the same as they did before they took it. I would stay away from drugs if you want to live a normal and fulfilling life and not suffer from mental/health problems later in life.

0	Faith in Evolution?  Faith in creation? Some say that the evidence for evolution is overwhelming. Some say the same about creation. There are those who believe in creation because it's attached to their belief in God,even if they can only explain it in unscientific terms. Some believe in evolution because it's attached to their atheism, even if they've never read a book on the subject. Many believe in either evolution or creation simply because it's what they've been taught. Other views might include combining evolution and creation,perhaps with some emphasis on one or the other. Finally,some don't think about it at all.\n\nSince the same evidence(nature)is available to all,why are there so many different opinions? Does it require as much faith to believe in evolution as it does to believe in creation? Research has revealed a 'God' gene, hinting why some people believe in God. Is there an 'atheist' gene also?  What might this mean if it were true? If God exists he must be rational as well as mind bogglingly powerful etc .\nA rational God would not want us to be slavish in our acceptance of him , because we are (more or less!) rational too.\nWe have entered the modern scientific age from an earlier stage where faith did not have to deal with awkward questions arising from the use of our rational minds .\nNot surprisingly this has put the religious apologists on the back foot . It is no kind of response to deny scientific discoveries and enlightenment.\nThe atom , with its electrons , neutrons , protons, now reveal hyperons , pions , mesons , muons , Higgs bosons , K-mesons , \nquarks , further divided into different types :eg: up , down , strange , charm , and on and on !\nThe question for scientists is ,is there rush to enlightenment similar to that of approaching the speed of light , so far but no further .\nIt is almost as if this all powerful and rational God just breathes the word "faith" as he steps back from our next childish question.\nHe reveals his glory to rational enquirers in a way that challenges them in the way they challenge belief . \nPerhaps a God gene is predestination , a gift to those who put innocent child like acceptance before wilful rejection .

I am convinced that there needs to be a very comprehensive answer to the problem of illegal immigration and sealing hte borders would be a great start. But is it possible? And are we also sealing the Canadian border? Probably not. I don't see too many illegal Canadian immigrants clamoring to jump the fence south. Posting National Guard troops is sort of scary because they are a military presence although the president says they will be there in a non-military function. Thisis a very different nation than the one I was lead to believe it was in school.
3	is it hard to become a cna.can they work anywhere else other then a nursing home? if yes where? No, it's not that hard, about a 6 week class.

3	Negative Effects of GMO to Food Production and Agriculture? PLeAse Help me i need to know wat are the negative effects of gmo(geneticaly modified organism) My personal view is because they are not as healthy for people or for the enviornment...the reason why they are not good for the environment is because the best produce to buy is that grown closest to home. Less gas is used and local farmers get the money as opposed to large corporations who are trucking it across the U.S. in refgridgerated trucks. I think there are lots of negative effects that would be hard to go into here but you should try looking up the positive effects of organic and locally grown conventional produce to get you started thinking. Does any of that help?

Research in bioinformatics includes method development for storage, retrieval, and analysis of the data. Bioinformatics is a rapidly developing branch of biology and is highly interdisciplinary, using techniques and concepts from informatics, statistics, mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, physics, and linguistics. It  has many practical applications in different areas of biology and medicine.\n\nVR

6	what is a virgin? In its most general sense, virginity is characterized by a state of unimpacted purity, usually stemming from a lack of experience (for example, newcomers to game Bingo could be referred to as virgins). Traditionally, virgin is used to describe a person who has not engaged in sexual intercourse. This use is traditionally restricted to a person who has not yet engaged in vaginal intercourse, but it is sometimes used to describe someone who has not engaged in sexual activities in general. Also, someone can be referred to as an "anal virgin," being a virgin to anal sex (specifically receiving anal sex). The status of "virginity" is sometimes respected and valued in certain societies, especially in relation to views of many religions on sexual conduct before marriage. The term maiden is also sometimes used to mean a virgin, although that can also refer to an unmarried or merely young woman.\n\nBtw, some cultures and religions have slightly different meaning.

After we went to a local irish pub, had a few drinks while we watched a irish folk singer, then I dropped her off at her house after spending all day together.  She told me that it was the best date she has ever had, because although we spend alot of time together in one day, it seemed like a minute, because of all the fun and the great converstion together.

6	How would demographics be useful if you wanted to start a business? Not everyone is your target market. Demographics allow you to determine your market and the number of your target market in order to verify whether the business can be profitable.\n\nOn the Web for example, a website needs to determine the demographics of their visitors -- their age, country, occupation and customer segmentation. These information can help them tailor their content to their audience. A website that attracts baby boomers, for example, would offer a different set of content from those that attract high schoolers.\n\nIf you are planning to open a restaurant and you are thinking of a high end fine dining gourmet restaurant. But the demographics of the area where you are planning to open the store shows that the residents in the area are low to middle class income families. Then it doesn't make much sense to open a high end restaurant -- unless you can find a way to bring the high income residents (your target market) to go to a low income place and dine.\n\nA catalog business offering men's products may go after professionals earning $100,000 a year, about 30-52 in age, who owns a house and drives a sports car. That's demographics at work.\n\nDemographics is an important tool in market segmentation. They are a way for you to find your perfect prospects!

And for the guy (smalltd28) who said Ali was not the greatest pound-for-pound ever, I respect your opinion, but that's crazy to say that. I'd say 95% of the people you ask will say Ali was the best pound-for-pound. Take away the last two losses late in his career and you'll see that he avenged the other three losses.

8	If ur boyfriend of  5yrs found out u cheated on him&stayed w/u,is it ok for him to always use it against u? This happened almost 3yrs. ago. & After he found out,he wanted to stay with me. We are still together now,but he uses it against me all the time. Any time we have an argument,he throws it in my face. It doesn't matter if he is right or wrong,when it comes down to it everything is my fault because of what I did. Shouldn't he leave if he isn't happy? I can understand how he would feel hurt and angry towards you, however, since he chose to stay with you after finding out, he needs to come to terms with his feelings.  If he can't then he's not being fair to you or to himself.  He either needs to let it go, or if he can not, then he needs to let you go.

9	Is OSHA allowed to make surprise inspections of manufacturing facilities without a reason? I think they have to give some notice...if so, how much notice? Yes they can do a surprise inspection with no notice, but the second part of your question (without reason) is another matter.  OSHA inspections result from worker or public complaints, safety violations you have reported, direct observation by an OSHA employee from nearby property, you are doing work that requires a safety plan that you have submitted, or it is just your turn on the list that they keep.  Many industries such as asbestos workers get inspected routinely as part of OSHA programs.  So they always have a reason, even if it is "just your turn".  You should also document the reason.  They should at least tell you in general.  If not, call the local office.
9	Did Stalin really Kill 20 Million Christians in WW2? We hear a lot about the holocaust agaisnt the Jews.. with Jewish war museums built in every country.. but never a peep about the fact that Stalin a jew.. killed 20 million Christinas while the holocaust was going on where 6 million apparently got killed..\n\nDoes anyone know the facts about this? Stalin literally starved millions of his citizens to death, withholding and confiscating grains and other food. These were his ordinary citizens, most commonly the peasants, so religious denomination had nothing to do with it. In that time frame and location, most would have been greek orthodox. \n\nSome stats:\n\nEarly researchers of the number killed by Stalin's regime were forced to rely largely upon anecdotal evidence, and their estimates range as high as 60 million.[13][16] But with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, hard evidence from the Soviet archives finally became available, and such estimates became more difficult to sustain. For example, the archives record that about 800,000 prisoners were executed (for either political or criminal offences) under Stalin, while another 1.7 million died of privation[citation needed] or other causes in the Gulags and some 389,000 perished during kulak resettlement - a total of about 3 million victims.\n\nThus, while some archival researchers have posited the number of victims of Stalin's repressions to be no more than about 4 million in total [15][16][17], others believe the number to be considerably higher. Russian writer Vadim Erlikman,[18] for example, has made the following estimations: Executions 1.5 million, Gulag 5 million, Deportations 1.7 million (out of 7.5 million deported), and POW's and German civilians 1 million, for a total of about 9 million victims of repression.\n\nSome have also included the 6 to 8 million victims of the 1932-33 famine .[18][19][20] But again historians differ, this time as to whether or not the famine victims were purposive killings - as part of the campaign of repression against kulaks - or whether they were simply unintended victims of the struggle over forced collectivization.\n\n\nEDIT: As for Stalin being a jew, you are quite incorrect.\n\n"Joseph Stalin was born Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili in Gori, Georgia, Russian Empire to Vissarion Dzhugashvili and Ekaterina Geladze. In 1913, he adopted the name Stalin, which is derived from the Russian stal’ (Russian: сталь) for "steel". His mother was born a serf."

4	what is the main pros and cons of Desktop chassis vs Tower chassis in computer ? I want to know what is the main technical draw back of Desktop Chassis Vs Tower Chassis in Computer ? Which chassis is technically ideal for business use ? The only difference (aside from size) is the number of available expansion slots.  If you have a desktop chassis and plan on adding internal hardware (like extra hard drives or CD/DVD drives), Desktop chassis on average will run out of room first.  The bigger desktop chassis will give you room for about 4 expansion slots in front whereas the tower chassis is only limited by how large a tower you can find.  So, to answer the part about which is ideal for business use, you need to know how much internal hardware you have now and plan to install in the future.  If you aren't doing anything too big hardware wise, the desktop chassis will probably just save you some space.

7	Best Led Zeppelin song...? ...and why it is... hey bud-\n\nthis is impossible but...\n\n"Achilles Last Stand" is the best song of Led Zeppelin.\n\nThe song is one of the longest Zeppelin songs, at 10 minutes and 25 seconds. The song is famous for John Bonham's immensely powerful drumming, John Paul Jones's galloping bass line (played on a custom made eight string bass), Jimmy Page's overdubbed orchestral guitar arrangement (incredibly the dozen or so guitar tracks on this song were recorded in one session), and a dramatic, epic guitar solo which is considered by many to be among Page's best.\n\nPage has been quoted saying that it is his favorite Led Zeppelin song, so that should go a long way\n\ni guess my personal favorite is No Quarter or How Many More Times

1	morethan inifinty? Consider a hotel that has an infinite number of rooms. Each room contains a person and hence the hotel is full since all rooms and all people stretch to infinity.\n\nNow a coach turns up with 10 more people looking for rooms. How does the hotel manager fit the ten new people into his hotel? An excellent question.  Here's what to do:\n\nCoach sends the first guy to room #1 and tells him to say "Coach says this is my room.  Move to the next one, and pass it on."  So he moves into room #1 and bumps the guy in #1 to #2, who bumps the guy in #2 to #3, etc.  \n\nIn most hotels, you eventually get to a guy who was bumped out of his room and has no place to go because he was in the last room and the hotel was full, causing a problem.  But this is Hotel Infinity, so that kind of problem can never happen, even when every single room in the hotel has somebody in it, because there is no last room.  \n\nAs soon as the first guy gets moved into room #1, coach sends the next new guy into room #1 and bumps everybody again, just like you just did.  When coach gets his 10 new guys moved in, he hits the showers.

2	Help me understand how families deal with cancer -  family has no extended family? ok this is kinda long, but I'm so confused -- my fiance' got diagnosed with stage 3 vocal chord cancer in August (he's 35 and was in air force)-- since then it's like his family has almost turned on me, his dad said some of the meanest thing at the beginning of his treatment , like told me to stay away since I'm not a part of the family, and moved his in with them (which is totally understand since his mother doesn't work and could watch him the whole time) But I don't understand it--- do some families just deal with crisis by shutting everyone else out and isolating the person sick?  My fiance and I have been together and lived to gether over a year - but being told not to come around hurt-- and now that his treatments are over he's different, and his family is still 'weird' if that makes sense... I don't know what to do about--- My fiance tells me to be patient a little longer< that he feels secure in our relationship, but then he stands me up Thanksgiving with his family I work in a chemo ward, and I see the things that families do to each other when one of them is diagnosed with cancer;\nI have seen partners shut out and isolated, I have seen people at each other's throats; everyone wants to be close to the patient; everyone wants to protect him.\nYour fiancee has been through a life changing event. He looks at life differently now. It must be very hard for you to be sidelined like this. How cruel of his family to shut you out at this time; this doesn't bode well for your future married life together.\nWrite to his family; say you would like the opportunity to clear the air - that you love him very much, and that you want to be part of his life - the bad bits as well as the good bits. Try not to allocate blame; and try not to be self pitying when you speak to them.\nIt sounds like your fiancee made his decision when he moved back in with them; I wonder why he felt he had to do that? For the moment, you may have to take his word that things are ok between you.\nI would think that things are not ok.\nYou are supposed to be his bride-to-be; you are on the verge of married life together. I wonder about his level of committment to you if he ran home when trouble raised it's head.\nSorry to be a devil's advocate here, but I would not be happy with that situation at all.\nTreatment does change people; families often close ranks against those whom they consider to be "outsiders". Still, I think they are being unesscessarily cruel here. Was there some conflict between you and them before his illness?Do they not approve of you for some reason?\nIt was a truly horrible and unchristian thing to do, to leave you out of Thanksgiving. It should be a time of rejoicing and reconcilation; and why did he not insist on you being invited?\nHaving cancer does not mean you turn into a little boy again.\nI'm very sorry for you, that is awful. You are suffering too, worrying about him and your future.\nI think you are entitled to some answers from him; a long talk between you both should be arranged. you are a part of his life, he should affirm that in some way, and if he does not, I would seriously wonder whether you should continue to wait for him.\nBest wishes.

2	Gas pains??? Hello all, I have realized sometimes I have gas pains that seem to be coming from my uterus. Like I feel pressure there. 2 days in a row I ate pizza for lunch and after the 2nd day I started having bad gas and the pressure is around my uterus area....What is this? should I be worried? has anyone else had this? Wow alot of these answers are horrible! \n\nYou are eating pizza and getting bloated and/or gassy. Everyone has certain foods that make them gassy or just make them feel not so good. For me, it's pop like coke or pepsi. For you, it's pizza. I would avoid pizza as much as you can. It might be the grease, it might be something else... depends what's on the pizza. I read one answer that said take a laxative.. wow.. k, don't do that... all that does is make you poop... alot. You can get some over the counter pills such as GasX... that gets rid of the gas for up to 12 hours. But I would just suggest avoiding eating things that make you feel this way. If they are really bad pains there could be a problem with one of these: gallbladder, pancreas, liver, aorta, kindey's or your spleen. So if they're bad, or it's causing you to have diareah, go to your doctor and they will send you to get a abdomen ultrasound and a G.I. series or barium swallow.\n\nHope this helped. Best of luck!

9	why is president bush pushing so hard for this port deal? why is president bush pushing so hard for this port deal, if these are American ports y dont american companies bid for them, y the push for UE to run them Please do note that this was not a "deal" that the administration cooked up.   It was a sale of a business by a private company which required, like many other sales involving work in the U.S., review by the administration to make sure it meets legal muster.  Nor was the "deal" covert -- it was made public several months ago (when the leading bidder for the London company's business -- a Singapore company-- withdrew their offer).\n\nSo, as a matter of legal fairness, if the company has followed all the U.S. laws there is no proper reason to disallow the sale.   To do so, on no legal grounds, is to tell an Arab country which has, since 9-11 been very helpful in combatting terrorism (in precisely such areas as port security, esp. container inspection), that the rules we apply to all other nations don't apply to them.  That would also discourage other Arab countries thinking of co-operating with us from thinking it's worth doing so.\n\nThere may also be some specific ways the UAE has helped us in the past few years that the administration cannot, for security reasons, give details about  (i.e., you don't want to divulge what you know about terrorist groups you are pursuing, nor all the sources of that information, because that would put them at risk and dry up potential sources, who would fear being outted themselves).   Of course, the administration would want to CONTINUE to get this kind of help and nixing business sales might threaten such assistance going forward.\n\nAs for the question, 'why a UAE business, not an American one?'   Simple answer: NO American companies bid to purchase the London company's business.  They were welcome to do so.  But, in fact, there really are not any American companies vying to manage these port terminal operations.  And again, the administration was never "pushing" for Dubai Port Worlds to make this purchase.  That agreement was made between the parties before the U.S. government had any involvement in the matter.\n\nFinally, it would be wise to inform yourself about what exactly the "business" is, who would be doing the actual work etc.  (Short answer -- it is basically about loading and unloading boats in specific port terminals, NOT running the entire port, much less port security;   the on site workers will continue to be the AMERICAN dock workers who worked for the London company selling the business.)\n\nThese, any a few other points, were made (more clearly) in an email from Bush administrations officials a couple of weeks ago.   I don't have a copy of the full text, but a number of excerpts may be found at the link below.

2	herniated disc help? My husband has a very painful herniated disc, for about 6 months he has been to physical therapy and got a little relief but they discharged him. He is now going to be going to a chiropractor does anyone have any advice, I don't know if surgery is where we will end up Hi 'Error'.  I am a retired Chiropractor.  I have treated many patients with hernited discs.  Many responded to chiropractic treatment and a few did not.  Usually patients that did not respond to chiropractic care eventually improved with appropriate surgery.  \n\nWhat has the Chiropractor told you and your husband?  How has the herniated disc been diagnosed - MRI? CT?  What level of the spine is involved?  How large is the herniation?  Are there any additional spinal conditions that might worsen the problem (e.g. spinal canal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis)?  These types of issues help predict treatment success and/or the need for surgery.\n\nWhat are your husband's symtoms?  Back pain only?  Leg Pain?  Leg pain only?  Are there any signs of neurologic damage?  Change in reflexes?  Muscle weakness?  Muscle atrophy (wasting)?  Again, these issues help predict likelyhood of treatment success.\n\nLastly, if treatment is likely to help, some improvement should be seen within 3-4 weeks. Of course, if there is improvement, continuing treatment to maximum improvement can take many months.  However, ongoing treatment without any significant improvement, month after month, with the hopes that 'in time' it will help, is not realistic.\n\nOops, one more point, if chiropractic treatment is unsuccessful for your husband, referral for a neurological consult should be the next step.  At that point you want to see a Neurologist and NOT a surgeon.  Neurologists specialize in DIAGNOSIS.  They will not be motivated by 'surgical dollars' to prescribe surgery.  While a surgeon would perform the surgery (note: spinal surgery should only be performed by a neurosurgeon - someone who specializes in spinal surgery), sadly, some surgeons never see a patient (with good insurance, of course) that doesn't need surgery.\n\nGood luck with Chiropractic.  It often works wonders.  But if surgery is needed, be sure to find the best.\n\nP.S. If you want to answer the questions I have listed here, I will check back and give your further feedback.

0	Why do Christians get upset over this? See details? The Da Vinci ode has a lot of people upset over the fact that Jesus might have married.  If he was, it was done correctly, because He had no sin.  So if he married and fathered children the lawful way, where is the sin?  Can someone explain to me why sex inside marriage is wrong?  Children in wedlock too?  \n\nI am a Christian, if Jesus was married, I have no problem with it.  It is just another example he gave on how to be Godly. They are bent out of shape because they are narrow-minded and unenlightened. Who knows, may ten, 100, or 1,000 years from now scholars will have a whole other list of theories regarding the life of Jesus ... can we expect the same behavior from the Jesus Freaks each time someone has a different idea?\n\nTo these people I say: Get over it. No one is asking you to change your belief system. If you don't like it - ignore it!

4	why do i get message that im using a computer that is registered out of the country? i was on a website that said i was out of the US It's likely that the site you visited looked up your IP address and decided you were not in the USA...  (You can get an approximete georgaphical lookup from some IP's, but the complexity of routing sometiems makes this very unreliable.)\nI'd guess the owners of the web site wanted to restrict the information to US consumers, perhaps for legal reasons, maybe because their products/services change from one place to another.

1	if we are inside in universum,we cant get out from here? if we born on this universum thats means that we cant go away? like light cant get out? dont you think there can be something faster than lightspeed?or slower then milisecond?thinks what we cant see but can feel`,i think there is something! is it possible that we travel in the time but we just don`t feel that? There are so many theories about this issue. String theory, parallel universes, tachyons (btw, tachyons are particles that  seem to be travelling faster than the speed of light) And to answer your question, maybe someday humans will be able to travel to another universe (if such a thing exists) But it would take tens of thousands of years of technological development. Some scientists have actually thought up ideas of how to travel to other universes, like sending nanobots containing human DNA through small wormholes, or building a particle acclerator so massive that it creates a wormhole.

9	verbal agreement between two individuals, cat and bird missing from home-theft? A family goes on vacation. Made a verbal agreement with a boy who would take care of animals while family is gone. The boy had the key to the familys home. He was supposed to feed and water bird and cat at the familys home and was to keep the dog at his house until the family got back. When the family did get back, the dog was gone, taken to a dog pound. The bird and the cat are missing out of the familys home. Would this constitute as unlawful entry and theft? No because the boy was authorized to care for the bird and cat.  It is not unlawful entry and theft.  He was careless.  You may sue, but you did employ someone underage to do an adult's job.

1	How does oxygen dissolve in water? oxygen is a non polar molecule, o2, how would this dissolve in a polar solvent such as water. Dissolved oxygen is vital to life but how does it get there. what ion would the oxygen form to dissolve, O- or O2-? Water, as a polar molecule, induces an accumulation of electron density (dipole moment) at one end of non-polar gas molecules such as oxygen (O2 ) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ). The electron cloud of O2 is normally distributed symmetrically between the bonded O2 atoms. When the negative end of the H2O molecule approaches the oxygen molecule, the electron cloud of the O2 moves away to reduce the negative-to-negative repulsion. A dipole (a molecule with positive and negative charges separated by a distance) results in the nonpolar O2 molecule and causes O2 and H2O to become weakly attracted to each other. This intermolecular attraction between the oppositely charged poles of nearby molecules is termed a dipole- dipole force. The creation of these forces explains the mechanism by which gases dissolve in water.

0	Would an on-line Tarot class be popular? I've read and studied Tarot for some 30 years.  I've often thought that if I could connect with someone who knows how to design a web site, I would create a Tarot instruction site, maybe with links to selling different decks.  (There are a great many designs of decks, you know.)  Would it be popular?  Make me a living? There are already TONS of them out there. Punch up tarot cards in any search engine and see what you find.  How successful they are I don't know.

2	Have you experienced feeling like your half between awake and dreaming, you didn't wanna move because? you thought you were at the edge of your bed and might fall? Or is it just me? not sure but maybe your talking about sleep paralysis: you kinda feel like you're awake but you can't move or that you might fall or you try to speak but you can't sorta like you're frozen awake---maybe that wiki thing has something -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis Sleep paralysis is a condition characterized by paralysis of the body shortly after waking up (known as hypnopompic paralysis) or, less often, shortly before falling asleep (known as hypnagogic paralysis). Physiologically, it is closely related to the normal paralysis that occurs during REM sleep, also known as REM atonia.\n\n \nThe Nightmare, by Henry Fuseli (1781) is thought to be one of the classic depictions of sleep paralysis perceived as a demonic visitation.Sleep paralysis occurs when the brain is awakened from an REM state into essentially a normal fully awake state, but the bodily paralysis is still occurring. This causes the person to be fully aware, but unable to move. In addition, this state is usually accompanied by certain specific kinds of hallucinations. This state usually lasts no more than two minutes before a person is able to either return to full REM sleep or to become fully awake,(more in the article but I didn't want the post to be too long.)  Thanks :-)

0	why do you believe in God? I was born into a world of God's love.  Before I was old enough to understand what it was, I was learning about God in Sunday school.  By the time I was old enough to make up my own mind about what I believed, I realized I couldn't imagine a world without God in it.\n\nAs an adult, I have felt the presence of the Holy Spirit in me, have heard what I believed to be God speaking to me, and have seen what I believed to be God's will at work in circumstances that could not be logically explained.  That is why I believe in God.
6	what is the diffrence between market order and limit order in stocks? Stocks are quoted with bid and ask prices. \n\nIf you place a small market order to buy, you will get filled near the ask. If you place a small market order to sell you will get filled near the bid. Market orders execute at the best market price going.\n\nWith a limit order you specify a maximum price you will pay or minimum price you will sell for. You might not get filled with a limit order.\n\nIf you really want to buy at the market, place a limit order 5 or 10 cents above the ask. Do the same below the bid if you want to sell. This way, if there is a moment of illiquidity, you're not getting filled at some outrageous price.

5	As  a sport fan whats your opinion about  expressing yourself  when watching a game in a stadium? Everything's okay while fans are supporting their team, without any violence. But I dont approve violent behavior, fighting, riping seats off, throwing things inside the stadium...fans dont get it - they wont achieve anything acting like that, they can only spoil the clubs reputation, they can be suspended and pay a large amount of money etc.\nNope..cant understand that way of expressing!!!
8	How does a person let someone know they hate them without directly saying it to their face or starting uproar? Why do you think it matters so much what the hater thinks about anyone? If someone hates another person - he or she is the one with the problem, regardless of what the other person did. You don't have control over another, you only have control over yourself. If this is where you want to invest your energy, don't expect the person you hate to give a damn. As a matter of fact, given your attitude, the other person may have beat you to it, but doesn't think you are worth the effort of displaying the hatred. Grow up, and get your own life.

7	If you howl at the moon, what do you do to the sun? I reach deep into my "Sol" and belt out a good hardy laugh.  But not all the time... only when she shines her light "just so" and blasts her rays for all to see.  Unfortunately, where I live the sun likes to play hide-n-seek all the time.  So when she's out there... all alone in the sky.... beaming her radiant light... I know she's ready for a good time.  And so, I laugh.... and smile and enjoy each moment I have with her.  Until she decides to become reclusive again and hide behind the clouds.

1	why is evolution attributed to Charles Darwin? Charles Darwin with his evolution. I attribute evolution to Natural Selection of favorable variations.\n\nCharles Darwin wrote "Origin of Species" ("On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life").  This book took previous thoughts on evolution, including those advanced by his grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, and put the ideas together in a stunning statement that put the variation of life in context.\n\nAnimal breeders long knew how to breed for favorable traits (artificial selection).  Darwin explained that nature, in an undirected manner, would tend to select for those lines that had a subtle advantage over longer spans of time.
4	How do you find out if someone has an email address? I'm looking for someone and want to know if there's a way to see if they ever get online. I've already posted on zaba. Is there anymore I can do if that person doesn't want their email address to be found, u won't. Most websites just tell u a way to contact that person if they use them but they never give out email addresses. That'd be pretty scary don't u think if just any1 could find out ur email address. Best thing is to look for nick names u know they'll use for example like on YA or u can check sites like hi5, namesdatabase or even ringo. U'll be able to send a mail to them but, u won't get their email add unless u already had it. So, why not just ask

9	I wonder how many honestly believe we are fighting "them" over there to avoid fighting "them" over here. Remember Iraq had NOTHING to do with 9/11.  If anything we turned Iraq into a cause and breeding ground for anti US terrorism. \nIn a while we may end up like the Russians did in Afghanistan. I agree with you, there was no reason to go to Iraq in the first place. However many people still believe the repuglican talking point that we are fighting them over there to prevent them from coming here which is an out and out lie. But with the repuglican propaganda machine cranked up with the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox news I guess you have to expect it. The truth will come out in history when George Bush has been outed for what he is and that is a war criminal that should have to answer for his crimes against the Iraqi people and his crimes against humanity.

0	Is it proper to have more than one baby shower? My sister is on her 5th child and is having a baby shower.  I thought that was only for the first one.  Or am I wrong? it depends. there are some families where the do one for every child, depending on the culture and traditions. do not feel obligated to buy an extravagant gift if you want to participate. some mothers have a large gap between children, such as me and my brother are 12 years apart, so my mother didn't have anything. others may choose to if they are with a different father, and it is the first grandbaby for that family also. \ntraditionally a baby shower was for the first child of a couple, but now days--- who sticks with all the tradition anyways?!?

She would get really pissed off whenever I opened the door for her.
1	how to  do treadmill force analysis? dynamic and static analysis Think.  \n\nStatic - put weighing scales on treadmill.  user stand on, measure the static force applied to the treadmill.  (which will be equal to the user's weight, so I can't see the point in that one....)\nDynamic - put the scales vertically in front of user, supported on a wall or similar.  The force exerted forwardly by the user pushing on the scales will be equal to the reaction force between feet and deck.\nYou could also mount strain gauges on the deck frame.  Check out readings for stationary and in-use times.

6	where can i buy family crest and history software? There is no such thing as a "Family" crest, although a dozen merchants will sell you a crest or coat of arms that was once issued to someone with your surname. Just Google "Coat of Arms" and look for a linkk neding in ".com".\n\nTwo genealogy programs will help you trace your family history, \nFamily Tree Maker\nRoots Magic\n\nThere are others. FTM is the market leader, I like RM better. They are both $29. Neither will do the work for you. They are to family History what "Word" is to a term paper - tools. You have to do the work. They make it easier, but it would take a couple of hours a week for a month or two on your part to get a good foundation.\n\nWrite if you are still interested. Most Yahoo! users are not.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nThe descent of arms was and remains strictly regulated by inheritance; only certain actual descendents of a particular armigerous (arms-bearing) person are entitled to his arms or a differenced version of them — hence popular associations of a coat of arms with all bearers of a surname are based on a misconception. Heraldry is mostly a hobby today; but in some countries (e.g. Scotland) it remains regulated by heralds and the assumption of another's arms is illegal.\n\nThe word "crest" is commonly used to refer to a coat-of-arms. However, in heraldry, a crest is just one component of a complete achievement of arms. The crest sits atop a helmet, which itself sits on the main and most recognizable part of the arms, the shield or escutcheon. Other elements may include supporters holding up the shield and a motto beneath. Crests can in fact be used on their own (this is particularly useful when there is insufficient space to display the entire coat-of-arms); but where the shield alone is used it should never be called a "crest".
6	Why do bad things happen to good people & vice versa? Hi, I don't know if you know and accept karma theory. If your being good and things are happening bad to you then just take it as all the consequences of your previous bad deeds are being washed away, and it will make you a better human being. Also it gives a nice opportunity to fine tune your self and see if you are really good and correct even the minutest of defects in you. Yes i understand what you say, i have been through such feelings, but i am sure in the end, if your good then for sure if you look at a bigger picture, you will definitely realize that whatever is happening is happening for your own good, but that may be a result in the long run.\nbest regards

3	wut are all the different type of writing styles? i kno there is narrative and explain and informational but theres more and im not sure wut the other styles are There are many "genres". One would be a response to literature essay, where it is a case of reading a literary work, then describing the insight you obtained from it. Of course, you must prove it by the evidence in the text. Next is the summary, where you again read something and breifly state the main plot. You again need to specifically tell the reader the theme of this work. Another one would be fiction/ nonfiction. It tells an experience, fake or not, and enetertains a reader but also gives the insight and the purpose of it. There is also a persuasive essay, and then the research writing. Those types of writing are the most common in the literary world.

I read a list of supposed "lies" by the President, about many topics such as 9/11, Iraq, Halliburton, Harriet Miers, etc.\n\nMy question:  Has Bush ever been conclusively PROVEN to have lied?   Or is it just a bunch of left-wing attacks against him?   And, if he was proven to have lied, why wasn't it all over the news? The perception is YES. The reality is NO. People are going to believe what they want. Funny how evil GWB is portrayed by some liberals when in reality, Clinton is the last proven liar in the white house. Is GW a little clumsy with his words? Does sometimes he come off a little dense? Sure. But, name the only president to be proven a liar and you find yourself a democrat. Funny...\n\nKristy is happy with Clinton's sex lies? That is the funniest thing I have ever read. I love the links that people provide. Like somehow because someone said so, it must be true. People would actually believe Bush was an alien if some "secret" document proving it was published.
7	why did 2pac die? He died because a hater was jealous. Thats why. He was driving around in las vegas and got shot. Its a shame to if you ask me that someone let jealously got to someone so much that they had to end someone elses life. Tupac was the best rapper and he would still be if he was alive.\n\nR.I.P Tupac\n*gone but not forgotten*\n\nIts funny too because the person who killed him did it so pac wouldnt be succesful. Pac is dead now, but still, his music is selling millions. Funny how karma works huh?
1	Is it normal if a child begins to grow grey hair? Well I'm not a child anymore I'm more of like a teenager but when I was eight years old, my hair began to grow grey hair (I have black hair). I never coloured my hair because my parents are afraid that if I coloured my hair it would ruin it and my grey hairs would multiply, but it is multiplying anyways. As of right now my hair isn't actually fully grey but there a lot of it that some people can see it. I didn't do anything about it so I've had it for six years now, but I've always been curious if it is normal. Some people just get grey hair earlier than others.  Its not abnormal.

3	How can I get a fake degree that empoyers will believe real? It is hard enough for someone with a real degree to find a job, let alone a person with a limited education and a forged piece of paper.
2	Can people with celiac disese have spelt? Nope... Wheat, barley, rye, oats, spelt, semolina, triticale, and kamut are on the no-no list for Celiacs. If you're looking at expanding your grain intake, try corn or masa, quinoa, rice, and buckwheat. If you're simply looking for a gluten free grain to use in baking try a mixture of white rice flour, potato starch flour, tapioca starch, and xantham gum. If you're looking for a bread to substitute for gluten-containing breads, try ordering online at www.kinnikinnick.com, the tapioca rice bread is decent when toasted. I personally prefer using Mission corn tortillas instead of bread. Only Mission brand taste good and are flexible enough to make a sandwich out of them (after microwaving, of course). For bread, you may also be interested in trying Gluten Free Pantry's Sandwich Bread. You need a breadmaker to make it, but it's worth the hassle.

Why some countries in the world use 220 volts 50 Hz while some 115 volts 60 Hz? e.g. India use former and USA us later for home electricity why there is no universal standardization for it?

3	I have a fear to speak in english with people. Pl advice me how to avoid it.? I am a adult and not an englishman but I have studied english and I've done some international exams like 'IELTS' and got enough marks (more than 75%) for reading and writing.But only around 40% for listning and speaking. Also I undestand that I feel shy when I speak in english with some one, because  usualy I do mistakes.But somehow I want to be fluvent in english. Beter advice highly appriciated.Thank you in advance. try speaking to yourself in english. and watch for your pronunciation. if you cannot remember a word, don't just use it in your language, try to describe what you are willing to say like you are talking to a foreigner. and for listening try to watch movies in english without subtitles watch BBC or CNN or channels like that. when you are speaking with somebody in english, don't worry if you don't understand what they're saying, just ask one more time, if you don't understand, ask again, there is nothing wrong with this. if you do not know the meanings of the words they are using, just ask, if you don't understand the word, ask him/her to spell it. there is nothing wrong with asking. after some period, you'll see that you are not asking any questions anymore, and you are more comfortable in speaking.

9	Is the protection ofneighborhood character simply the afluent imposing monocultural norms on a diverse sociey? wow, good question. i don't think that protecting a neighborhood's character means imposing monocultural norms...\n\nthere are certain things that seem to transcend cultures (within most western nations at least). for example, don't do anything that is in direct violation of the rights of your neighbors (insanely large add-ons to your house, noise pollution, etc.)
3	Relocating to the U.K.? My husband and I currently live in the U.S. but since Bush has it so screwed up we're thinking of moving out of the country.  How is the lifestyle in London?  or other metro British cities.  We want to move next year.  Also, I'm a teacher and I need to know the qualifications to become teacher for SPED. I think you are doing the right thing although Blair is a right wing looney tune like Bush. London is very, very expensive for housing you would be better off moving to NE midlands (Lincolnshire,Norfolk,Suffolk) where people are under much less pressure and are friendlier. The weather is better on the Eastern side too. You will find it 5000% better than the US which is just dog eat dog and I'm alright Jack, stuff you. It must be a terrible place to live. I am living in Australia at the moment but was born in England, not far from the Humber bridge. I have lived in Canada and spent time in NY state. Good luck Jules.
7	A simple U2 trivia question? In U2's album Vertigo, the band remade a song by a German band who were a massive success in the 70s & 80s. Name this particular song & the German band. Wow... you got me.  I didn't know that U2 even HAD an album called Vertigo.  I know they have a SONG called Vertigo, though.  Are you sure on the album title?\n\n~~~~\n\nOkay thanks for the clarification - then that would be Kraftwerk's "Neon Lights" - a better cover than OMD did on "Sugar Tax", but still not as good as the original.\n\nAnd I'd argue that Kraftwerk are STILL a success with the sales of their latest album (and dbl-cd live album) and their sold out world tour as good examples.\nProps to U2 for covering a true classic...

0	What are masons? Is it a religion? A fraternal organization? What do they do or stand for or believe in? Freemasonry is a large and diverse group of human beings. I cannot not speak for all or even most of them. I will speak only for what I have experienced.\n\nFreemasonry is not a religion. In our Order, we say it is a kind of morality, veiled in allegory, and illustrated by symbols. \n\nWe stress the Golden Rule (do unto others as you would have them do unto you). There are many other rules of conduct that we find work in the betterment of oneself and the world. Some of those expressions have come into wide use in English: someone who "levels" with you, treats you "square," etc.\n\nWe speak about moral lessons in story form. I am sure you know things like "the little boy who cried wolf" (that is an example of allegory, a story with a moral). \n\nWe use the tools of operative masons (those who build real buildings) as symbols, as objects for contemplation and study. When we teach by symbols, we learn much about the inside of the person asking about them as well as those hearing the response. \n\nFor some Freemasons, the organization is strictly fraternal and devoted to good works. That in itself is a wonderful thing. The Shriners (an offshoot of the Freemasons) have hospitals that treat children with burns and disabilities free of charge.\n\nFor some Freemasons, Freemasonry is the heir to the Ancient Mystery schools. It is a way of achieving what some have termed enlightenment. As far as I know, Freemasonry works to make good people better. \n\nWe do, at least in my Order of Freemasonry (American Co-Masonry) insist that the candidate for admission must believe in a Supreme Being. We do not press them further about that belief. We thus admit Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, etc. We insist also that the person is of good character already, not an anarchist, and is of age (usually 21).   \n\nWhere American Co-Masonry differs from those others calling themselves Freemasons (or "real" Freemasons) is that we admit women to full membership, rights, and privileges. We admit all races, also.\n\nIf you wish more information, feel free to write to me and click on the link below to read more on our history.
9	How long must I stay married to a US citizen to get my green card? Will I have just the green card and/or I'll become a US citizen as well? You can apply for a green card as soon as you're legally married to a US citizen.  It can take anywhere from a couple months to a couple years to get approved depending on your location and the circumstances.\n\nOnce you get your green card you're a conditional permanent resident but not a US citizen.  You have to apply two years later for non-conditional permanent residency.  At any point during this process you can be revoked if you're no longer married.  You generally are not subject to revocation if you are the victim of spousal abuse.\n\nUS citizenship is separate and you can generally apply after seven years of legal residency.

8	Do you believe that homosexuality is a personal choice or something that is beyond an individual's control? It's not a choice someone can make. Someone can no sooner choose to be gay than someone can choose to be straight. You can fight the feelings, but you can't change them. You are who you are. You just need to accept it. It doesn't make you a bad or evil person. You didn't choose this lifestyle, just embraced what you had. I think people need to realize this.

Doing anything that takes your eyes off the road or that distracts your attention from driving is dangerous. \n\nThat said, I'm guilty of the text message thing. *blush*

When you spell please as 'plz' you should fail outright and without question.
6	Why doesn't Cablevision's $10 planned dividend generate more buying interest? I would expect traders to bid the price up close to or above $33 ($10 above the 52-week high). I'm assuming that people could buy it now and then turn around and sell it on or after April 25th while pocketing the $10 per share.\n\nAm I misunderstanding the possibility (or non-possibility) here? The thing is, when a stock goes ex-dividend, the share price gets adjusted by the amount of money taken out by the dividend...  The other problem is that the Dolan family is just plain scary...  Just look at the Knicks!
1	why normal house fan has three blades? The short answer is that three blades do the job.  Even the largest wind turbines using blades nearly a football field long commonly use three blades.  Although four or five blades may work better, the additional improvement likely does not justify the added weight and cost.  Also consider that there is a "wake" behind each moving blade and depending on rotating speed and air velocity, too many blades would prevent each blade from biting clean air.  As a fan becomes larger, the circumference at the tips is also larger and perhaps larger fans can use more than three blades efficiently.  I just noticed that my window fan uses five blades and is much smaller than a ceiling fan but rotates much faster (higher air velocity) on high speed.

5	A question about Muhammed Ali .....? How many matches did he have ?\nHow many matches did he win ?\nHow many matches did he lose? \nWho did he lose to ?\nWhat was his best techniques he used ?\nWhat were some of his best matches ?\n... Or any other information. Thanks so much. 61 bouts\n56 wins\n5 losses\nOnly losses :Joe Frazier, Ken Norton, Leon Spinks, Larry Holmes, Trevor Berbick\nThe left jab, combinations, and incredible speed and footwork.\n\nHe had classics with Joe Frazier. His greatest bouts were against Sonny Liston I, George Foreman, and he had good battles with Ken Norton - probably his toughest opponent next to Joe Frazier.\n\nAli was the first heavyweight to regain the title on 3 separate occasions. And for the guy (smalltd28) who said Ali was not the greatest pound-for-pound ever, I respect your opinion, but that's crazy to say that. I'd say 95% of the people you ask will say Ali was the best pound-for-pound. Take away the last two losses late in his career and you'll see that he avenged the other three losses.
7	What is your favorite comedy? mine is Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. U gotta c it Mr Bean
3	senior paper on conformity in fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.  Help? I would guess you are asking how the book shows conformity. To that I would have to point out that in the book there is little to no reading material. The people only see art through their television which is run by the government. Without seeing any creativity through either written form or other artistic outlets, a person would not have any thoughts against their given reality. \n\nThe book runs along the same lines as the movie 1984 which also has the theme of destroying all manner of creativity and controlling the population through created and fabricated information. \n\nThe book does show though that even though people can be fed false information, eventualy (in the case of the main character) they will reject their created reality and will go off in search of the truth. Much the same happend in the movie 1984 and other similar big brother style movies and books. Even the popular movie The Matrix has similar ties in that people are forced into a fabricated reality and over time many come to believe something is wrong with their existance and question what is real and what is not.

1	Which is there more of? odd numbers, even numbers or all the whole numbers? The set of odd numbers, even numbers and whole numbers all have the same cardinality (that is, there is a bijection between them)\n\nThere is a bijection between the whole numbers and the odd numbers as follows:\n\nf(t)=2(t)+1; t an integer\nThis is injective since suppose f(t)=f(s).\nThen 2(t)+1=2(s)+1\n=>t=s\nIndeed, it is surjective, since any odd number can be written in the form 2(m)+1, where m is an integer (whole number), and thus f(m)=2(m)+1\n(a bijection is a function that is both injective and surjective, that is, it is 1-1 and onto)\n\nSimilarly with the even numbers:\nDefine g(t)=2t; t an integer\nThen this is injective, for suppose g(t)=g(s)\nThen we have 2t=2s=>t=s\nIndeed, it's surjective because any even number can be written as 2m, where m is an integer.  \nThus, for any 2m an even number, 2m=g(m).\n\nIn fact, each of these infinite sets are denumerable, that is, there is a bijection from the natural numbers into the set of the odd numbers, there is a bijection from the natural numbers into the set of even numbers and there is a bijection from the natural numbers into the integers.\n\nSo you could say that the infinite sets of odd numbers, even numbers and integers all contained the same "number" of elements, even though this "number" is actually an infinite number.
0	Does the world no that they are actually celebrating an Ethiopians birthaday? The original cult of the mother and child, Semiramis and Tammuz, became later Isis and Osiris, Venus and Adonis, the madonna and child in various cultures down to this day. \n\nSemiramis declared that her son, Tammuz, was in actuality the return or rebirth of her husband, Nimrod. this is where reincarnation was born. And since Tammuz was born on the day corresponding to December 25, this day was highly honored and recognized by Nimrod's supporters. Note, therefore, that this date (December 25) was observed in honor of the birth of Tammuz long before Christianity existed, and that it was not until many centuries later this pagan custom was "Christianized" as being the birthday of Christ (or Christmas day). "It can be stated they worship another Jesus" \n\nNimrod's followers began to also worship Semiramis. And her son Tammuz was worshipped as well. Semiramis was revered by the people and was viewed by many as a priestess and goddess. She soon became known as "the queen of heaven." Thus began the awful practice of exalting human deities. These false beliefs have led up to the many different forms of idolatry that are still practiced by different people today. Yes, it was through the introduction of these satanic evils and the many sacrilegious practices of ancient Babylon that witchcraft, priestcraft, spiritualism, and other forms of paganism were born. \n\nOn the 25th of December, is "The birthday of the unconquerable Sun" (Natalis Solis Invicti). The ancient pagans believed that the sun would die during the winter solstice and then rise again from death as the solstice ended and the days of light began to lengthen, with the sun climbing higher in the sky, regaining its dominance. December 25 was also regarded as the birth date of the Persian/Iranian mystery god Mithras, the Sun of Righteousness, the god of light, the Grand Deliverer. The Sun God Mithras was a popular deity in the Old Roman Empire, whose cult penetrated the Roman world in the first century B.C. Yes.  I knew this, and I am extremely impressed that you have done your research.  Great job!
1	will we find life on mars, where did the water go,under ground sea? I am just worried that if we investigate too much, Mars will attack!  Oh my.  \n\nSeriously tho, or as serious as I can get, I have read that they have found great quantities of frozen hydrogen just under the soil.  The interesting thing about frozen hydrogen is that it is the basis for water.  Perhaps if Mars ever did have a "thick" atmosphere, when it was ripped away, the oxygen "boiled" out and all that was left was the hydrogen.
3	how would you? how would you....or how can you prevent erosion? Soil erosion or shoreline erosion?\nshoreline:\nOn property with steep slopes or bluffs, reducing the amount of water reaching the bluff will help with stabilization. If diverting water away from the bluff is impractical, it should be routed through a non perforated plastic drain pipe that outlets at the very bottom of the bluff. Rock should be placed around the outlet to prevent erosion at the bottom of the drain. Surface water and some ground water can be intercepted before it reaches the bluff by installing a "French drain" \nother:\nYou can grow hydorgrass or put down some type of netting onto the ground to prevent erosion.

5	What are the songs the German fans sing when rooting on the national football team? I was just at the World Cup match in Munich and couldn't make out the various songs the German fans were singing in support of their side.  Could anyone tell me what those songs are and maybe post the lyrics. The national hymn is sang of course but not with the line "Germany, Germany over all" This is forbidden since the second world war. Only the third line is allowed.\n\nTypical football songs are:\n\n"Steh' auf, wenn Du ein Deutscher bist" (Stand up if you are a German) to the tune of "Go West" from Pet Shop Boys\n\n"Ihr könnt nach hause gehn" (You can travel home)\n\n"Schwarz und weiß, wir stehn an Eurer Seite" Black and white we stand at your side\n\nHope this helps

0	When will Prince Charles become King of England?

6	Engineering Management or International Business and Management? I've already finished my 2 years in automatics (engineering) in Lithuania, but I'm not satisfied with quality of teaching here. So I decided to study in UK. \n\n2 years ago I gained an ECDL and finished 1 year course in comp. school. I've some notion about programming ( but I don't like it... very much).\n\nAnd I want to word in management/Business environment.\n\nPlease, help me to choose the course:\n1) Engineering and Management\n2) Computing Business\n3) International Business and Managment\n\nI want to get a job ~80 000 $ per year \n\nI also don't like physics.. I can learn it, but I quickly forget what I've learned... it's hard for me My advice will be a stretch since I'm American and aren't as familiar with the UK programs (you may want to post on Yahoo Answers UK).  I do work in high tech though, so maybe I can help.\n\nThere is quite a lot of money in engineering management, but unless you like coding and/or working with engineers, you should probably steer clear.  Most engineering managers, at least in the US, are fairly hands on when it comes to programming.\n\nOf course, there are roles like program, product, or project management which lead development teams without a reporting relationship.  These can be pretty high paying jobs that don't require you to program, but do require to have a foundational understanding of technology to be able to gather business requirements and dream up products around them.  This might be a plausible role coming out of an engineering and management course.\n\nBoth Computing Business and International Business sound like good areas of study.  Could keep you in high-paying industries, but on the business end.  An example job could be in strategic planning for a software company, or business development even.  Your engineering background would give you an edge there.  Given what you've stated about yourself, I would probably go for one of those.

Do what I said, and fast. Just grab the goat, and pick up the knife. Then use the matches......\n                                       Love, God.

6	What is everyone's earliest being a baby memories, like sitting up or crawling for the first time? Are there other memories like being changed or walking for the first time.  And are their memories with playing with children but both of you where not able to talk yet just baby jibberish, and you understood each other, because I do remember that, and I remember trying to sit up and falling over and everyone was laughing at me and I thought they were silly and I thought it was funny to that I could not sit up. My very earliest memory was at age 3.  On my 3rd birthday, We went to pickup my grandmother, I walked into her home first and she was sleeping on the couch.  I tried to wake her up, and she would not wake up.  I shook her, telling her to get up, it was my birthday and we were there to take her to our home for my party.\nMy grandmother had died.  I was too young to be upset.  I did not understand death.  I went home, told my brother that grandmother was dead, and went on with my party.\nI remember every detail, every word, of that entire day, but nothing prior.

7	"Bewitched" question:  Since Serena was Samanth's cousin and Endora's niece, does that mean (continued) she was Uncle Author's daughter?\n\nWhat's your take on it? No.  Uncle Arthur never married but occasionally had girlfriends.  It had to be from her father's side of the family.\nBy the way.  Arthur may have been gay in real life but he was not on the show.  As I said before, he had a few pretty girfriends.\nSerena was not Aunt Clara's daughter.  She never had any children.

1	How do you differentiate 2^x? Thanks!? I'm thinking its ln2 but not sure... y = 2^x\n\nln y = ln 2^x\n\nd/dx ln y = d/dx ln 2^x\n\nd/dx ln y = d/dx x*ln 2\n\nPull the constant (ln 2) out:\n\ny'/y = ln 2 * d/dx x\n\ny'/y = ln 2\n\ny' = y * ln 2\n\ny' = 2^x * ln 2\n\n*** Remember this advice, kids.  Whenever you want to get rid of a variable exponent during differentiation, use logarithmic differentiation.  Using it will make things cleaner and easier.
9	I need advice picking a military career? I'm 24 years old, and I really don't want to have to shoot anyone. I don't have a high school diploma, only a GED. That most likely disqualifies me from the Airforce, and the Coast Guard. They accept them but rarely from what I have gathered. I have looked at the Army as a last resort throughout my life. Even though I know that I would do very well within it. I want to be in a intelligence or medical MOS since it would help me when I'm done with my term. I want to know if there is any way to go active, but not be in a combat deployable position? I'm just trying to make sure I make a wise decision and not a foolish one to my own personal morals. I want to join, but love my job... not hate it. I understand about wanting to go into the service. It looks like it might be a way to pay the bills and get some education and a way up. For some of us it was. I was a chemical staff specialist. My job started out being in radiation protection. That was great. It eventually got me where I am today. I teach the stuff in a nuclear power plant.\n\nBut wait.\n\nThe Army decided that they needed me to make and drop napalm, agent orange, white phosphorus, and other stuff like that. I got sent to Vietnam. I was a good soldier. Did what they told me. Even got tortured in training without talking (South Koreans broke my knee in a training exercise). I dropped napalm on people, dude. Burned them to death. Sprayed Agent Orange that we later found out caused all sorts of genetic defects and liver problems in the Vietnamese and in our troops. I watch a helicopter blade take off my pilot's head when we crashed once.\n\nDid not seem much like radiation protection somehow. \n\nAnd then when I got back people spit on me. They called us baby killers. The sentiment about the war had changed. There was no money much to treat vets either (a lot like it is now, btw) and my buddies were very screwed up. I hear that US soldiers coming back now 1 in every three are seeking help about PTSD. Yeah, good idea to seek help. I still have it. Fourth of July is hell for me. Hate unexpected fire crackers.\n\nThe job of the military is to meet with and kill the enemy. The recruiters will try to tell you there are lots of other things to do, but that is the number one job. Right now we are not at war, we are occupying a country that does not want us there. The Iraqi president and VP have both asked for us to leave, have talked about granting amnesty to those who have only killed Americans. The troops on the ground there are tired. They are there to protect the contractors who are raking in the dough on fat no-bid contracts. \n\nAre you sure you want to do this?\n\nHow about something like Americorps or Peace Corps? \n\nIf you still are intent on the Army, get everything in writing. When they try to weasel out, show them the paper and leave. Seriously. Recruiters lie and cheat.

2	Hi, Is it normal to have man boobs (not big) at 15 years old? I've seen some my age have and some don't. I've seen other people my age, that do have man boobs and some don't, will these eventually go down? My doctor says it's there for room to grow (during puberty) it wasn't there when I was younger. (I'm tall but not overweight) I agree with your doctor, you're only 15 now, your hormones are all over the place, and your chest will need the extra space once your upper body muscle starts growing in....but...\n\nIf you have to ask this one again at 18 or 19, I'd go to a doctor, have my blood tested for hormones.  Really.  Hypo-gonadism is no joke, and neither is hypo-pituitary syndrome.  You did say you were tall though, so if it continues to be an issue in 3-4 YEARS from now, check to make sure your body is producing enough testosterone.\n\nYou may, if you can afford it, also wish to have a combined blood/sperm test for chromosomes....a small number of guys are born with Klinefelter's syndrome, which basically means they get an extra X sexual chromosome, being an XXY male instead of the normal XY.  But that is really rather rare.\n\nAnd like I said, you are too young to sweat it now....give it a few years, if you find yourself having chest/breast issues as you get closer to 20, that is when you need to look into it.

Since your budget seems willing to spend a little. Here is a great idea. Since you have created your list. Look in your photo albums and find your favorite (nice) picture of you and your friend (each of them or you all as a group). Go have copies made and buy frames for them. Take the time to hand write out what made you pick that friend and that picture. It will make the reciever appreciate your friendship knowing that you think the world of them. Put the nice picture in a box and wrap it up with bows and ribbon. It will be a unique gift. Or you could scrapbook them a page and frame it of your fav. times together. Good luck and Merry Christmas
2	After having my gallbladder removed about a week ago, I would like advice on a low fat diet? After the operation I was violently sick, and I was vomiting vile brown liquid, which was the contents of my stomach. I asked to see a nutritionist as I could not hold any food down, but my request was refused. As I retain anesthetic, I was sick for the next 48 hours, and had to be given saline drips intravenously to combat dehydration. I was also given anti-sickness injection and morphine. I still feel nausea now and I am hoping to get advice on a low fat diet, as I feel this would help me and my partner who has a heart condition. I still feel very weak, and I seem to fall asleep when I least expect it. Hope to hear from you soon and I would be very grateful for any advice.\n                                      Alexandra Robertson I would think that you falling alseep all the time has something to do with you not getting the proper nutrition.  Can you take some sort of multi-vitamin during this time?  If you are still feeling nauseated, start with dry toast.  See how you keep that down.  Go from there.  Stay away from fatty, greasy, or fried foods.  Is this what you are looking for?  You seem to know that you need to stick to a low fat diet.  Soup, toast, chicken breast & rice, salads with fat free dressing..........

4	What skills do you need to be a level designer? I also have another questions. What is the main program that companies use, so i could get some expirence with it. Assuming that you are refering to graphic design or web design I will answer your questions.\n\nFirst program to learn is Photoshop by Adobe.  Photoshop is the industry leader in raster based editing but it also works with vector based images.  Photoshop is used to create graphics, edit photos, create web pages and much more.  Total Training has excellent DVD training videos for starters.  They are kinda expensive but so is Photoshop.  ;)\n\nSkills needed;  Learn your software packages like Adobe, flash, etc.  Also learn your theory.  Be sure to understand how a computer works - things like RAM, processor speed, monitors and peripherals.  Study compatibility across operating systems like Windows, MAC, Unix/Linux, etc.\n\nMy recommendation is to get formal training from a school.  This will ensure that you are learning the right things and it lets your employer know that you are qualified.

6	Do you ever feel like everything you ever thought was right, could have been a mistake? Sometimes do you make a judgement just to find out that your whole perception was wrong? Good one kermit.\n\nNow, everything is a learning process.  I think it is important to have passion for your beliefs but at the same time always remain open for debate.  If anything, if you are on the wrong side of logic or common sense on something, you're bound to discover it sooner.\nWe have to make judgements and decisions at fixed times in our lives.  Rather than beat yourself up over the past, try and flesh out a good process for how you analyze things and react to them, then use that process and adjust as needed.  Use the past to learn from and keep growing! Also, really look into anything that contradicts deeply held beliefs and run it through a vigorous ringer before you assume you were wrong.  You've made it this far on your wits and common sense, there's a good chance you've been right more than you give yourself credit for. There are lots of contrarian views being floated out there that are nothing more than hot air, so have confidence in yourself too!

3	adhd, add, or learning problems what do you think that school should do? well this is a tough subject because there are people that feal drugs are the key and I for one am agenst the drug use,\nbut the qeustion is how to help parents teachers/schools help kids with special needs like reading writeing ect. cause there arent enouph people helping out. the teachers just throw us in the back of the class and say try to keep up if not then to bad. emagin one special eds teacher for 6 kids imposible one is in 7 and the rest are in higher grades. and the other question is why arent the schools doing any thing about it?\nyes I am one of the less helped when I was in school I have ADHD and a couple of learning disabilitys. and I gues I just hate siting back while other kids that need help get treated like dirt and are forced to think of it as well there is always manual labor.\nand I would like to hear others answers to these big problems. is drugs the key to study or is it finding that one thing that makes them happy and try to help them learn? In my opinion, do what you have to do to adapt. \n\nPlenty of people in years past got through and did so without excuses. I have ADHD, and a craptastic memory. But I have relied on compensatory devices, mnemonics, tape recorders, associations (e.g. neighbor named savannah, I think of girl-scout cookies), etc.\n\nSo I use technology, ranging from my PDA to the old fashioned notebook to keep up with everything. I have a heavy load atm in the nursing program...8-10 chapters every couple of weeks, with skills labs, care plans, hospital rotations, yada yada yada. \n\nAnd hey, I've always had to go through information two the three times longer than your average student but I'm keeping up with this very heavy courseload. \n\nThing is, you just have to adapt to the situation and get your responsibilities taken care of. Few people in life have everything laid out for them, the rest of us have to keep up and work on our weaknesses where we can.\n\nFailure is the price of laziness, and not being prepared. \n\nToo many people want to look for an excuse to explain away their shortcomings. Or better yet, want to cast blame. But like ya said, the teachers can only do so much. Problem is that this society has begun to frown on recognizing greatness, frowns on the use of red pens because they are too "negative," frowns on creating standards that separate the hard working from those who don't add up.\n\nThen the problem is exacerbated when you consider there are so many parents out there that have no damn business being parents. Or the politicians more concerned with garnering votes that keeping the bar raised to an internationally competitive level.\n\nHell I could go on and on. Basically, it's the fault of the republicans, the democrats, the parents, the kids, the teachers, society in general, the pharmacological ass-kissers, my dog sam, and a bunch of other pricks I'm probably not even thinking about atm. \n\nI really could go on and on all day...but basically the moral of this is that the school should do nothing. The schools are there just to provide a foundation. It is the responsibility of society as a whole to make sure that students are prepared, that they have the resources available to them, and that everyone doesn't come out a freaking moron who isn't prepared for life.\n\nThe main problem with medications is that they only treat the symptoms, not the underlying problems. In many cases this is the only option, but hey consider all the kids you know on ADD drugs...hyperactive, failure to concentrate, poor social skills...that is EVERY child I have EVER freaking known! Where I come from, that's normal. \n\nBut get some jerk doctor in the new health care system where "patients" magically become "customers" (crock of $#!* if you ask me) , who will quickly throw a prozac, ritilin, etc. at a patient just to make them feel like they've done something...and the problem is exacerbated. \n\nMeanwhile those who are trully suffering and could benifit from a more disciplined approach falter as pills are thrown at them. \n\nWith all of this having been said, i'll take psychologists and their drugs over tom cruise and the scientology group any day. \n\nWow want a whiney rant, sorry if that doesn't answer your question and hey, hopefully it helped anyway.
4	What are the bare minimum specs for a laptop to efficiently browse the internet? Basically looking for whatever is the cheapest ($200 and under for used/refurbished) that can run the internet smoothly because I'm looking to buy in bulk.  Thanks. If you want to have a pleasant experience in dealing with a 'bulk lot' of machines for web browsing you really want to get something that can run XP Pro.\n\nIf you are going to try and keep ME/98/95 etc secure for web browsing you have a lot more work to do than if you are running XP Pro.\n\nWith XP Pro you can administer the machines as part of a network and you have access to the far better security tools that Microsoft put into XP and the tools that others supply for XP. With anything before XP you have to know what you are doing and have to be prepared to put in the work to keep them secure etc. Can be done but life's too short in my opinion.\n\nSo the summary is the minimum specs you should be looking at, in my opinion are the minimum specs for XP Pro which are here\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/upgrading/sysreqs.mspx\n\n///

1	what are the main  chemical components of hair relaxers? Sodium Hydroxide is the strongest type of principal chemical used in some chemical relaxers because it provides the most long lasting and dramatic effects. However, this same sodium hydroxide is found in drain cleaners which well demonstrates the strength of this chemical. It is what is used in products that are referred to as “lye” relaxers. The strength varies from a ph factor of 10 to 14. With higher ph, the faster the straightening solution will take hold, but the more potential the damage. \n\nGuanidine Hydroxide is the other common option of relaxer chemical used today. This is what is referred to as “no-lye” relaxers. This label can be misleading to some consumers. It does not imply that there aren't any strong chemicals used or that the chemicals used are somehow less potentially damaging. Some have mistakenly thought that with “no-lye” relaxers there are less steps and all the worry of chemical hair straightening is removed. Although this type of chemical hair relaxer can be less damaging than its counterpart, the hair and scalp should be in top condition before attempting treatment, and this type also requires special care when applied. \n\nAll relaxers require conditioning treatments before and after application. The decision to straighten the hair chemically requires much forethought and really a commitment to healthy haircare treatments over a long entire period of time.
8	i know this boy and he asked me out? i havnt told him yes or no, i would like to date him but im embarresed of my faimily and afraid they might embarres me in front of him , will some one give me advice If your parents love you and this person is worth having then they will like them. Ask your parents not to embarrass you. Maybe they will understand. You only get two parents in your life and they won't always be there but, they will be there to see you through the heartaches. Just because you parents live a certain way dosn't mean you have to be that way too. Maybe if your parents knew you felt this way they would change!!!!! this person is not worth having if they would do you that way anyway.

0	Where did the oath of celibacy(withstanding from sex) come from in Priesthood and Nunhood? And Why? I'm not catholic, but I do read the bible and go to a non-denominational church. But, in reading the bible,I don't read of God asking man to commit to celibacy if they choose to be a leader of his flock.  I feel that humans just make life harder on themselves by envoking unnatural laws for themselves to follow, when God only asks us to love and serve him, etc.. Humans were made sexual beings and that's probably why the priests are sleeping with altar boys, nuns, members of the congregation, etc, because physically and mentally we're meant to be with someone in that special way, not alone.  I'm sure that the priests and nuns probably favor themselves manually, in private, to help with all of that pent up sexual frustration and tension.  I respect them to the highest, but just don't buy in to the notion that one must not have sex with a (wife or husband) to lead a God's people. Just as long as they're not sleeping around and it's a wife or husband, done in holy matrimony. That's my view. Catholism has a lot of mixture, therefore many of the traditions, rites and sacraments, are not to be found in the Bible, or in the ancient Christian doctrine even Paul mention it on 1st Timothy 4:1-3 1  Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;  2  Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;  3  Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.  Hislop says that when the cult to Cibeles an acient babylon godess was established in Pagan Rome, it was established in its primitive form, with a celibate priesthood!!! *The two Babylons Alexander Hislop).\n\nSo my friend Celibacy is not a CHRISTIAN doctrine it has it's origin in pagan cults, and was introduced to the catholic church, and also fathom this How did the Apostle Peter alledglly the first Pope, had a mother in law??????  Even their first pope wasn't celibate right!!
0	christians - what is your opinion about speaking in tongues? the speaking of tongues and other miracles that the apostles did back then, according to Acts, chapter 1 and on...was going to be cut off, no more of that...so if today someone speaks in tongues, and argues to have the holy spirit of God, Is really a Demons what he or she has in it...so be carefull and get away from it...

4	How to display a message box on the click event of a button in Windows Programming (VC++) ? Hi folks!... I have created a window and a button on it using VC++ 6.0. Now, I want to display a messagebox in response of the click event of button. Please guide me what code to write in the Windows Procedure?. Here is the Windows Procedure:\n\n/* Assume that the main window name is Window1 and button name is Button1 */\n\nLRESULT CALLBACK\nWindowProcedure (HWND hwnd, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)\n{\n    switch (message)                  /* handle the messages */\n    {\n        case WM_DESTROY:\n\n            PostQuitMessage (0);       /* send a WM_QUIT to the message queue */\n            break;\n  \n\n      default:                      /* for messages that we don't deal with */\n\n            return DefWindowProc (hwnd, message, wParam, lParam);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} Hello,\n\nYou have to check for the event WM_COMMAND in your switch instruction. And inside that case, check the wParam value (High order byte) of the event to make sure it is a BN_CLICKED event. At that stage, you need to further identify your button using the wParam (Low order byte) of the wParam.\n\nExample:\n\n        case WM_COMMAND: \n          if (HIWORD(wParam) == BN_CLICKED) \n          { \n                switch (LOWORD(wParam)) \n                { \n                    case ID_OF_YOUR_BUTON: \n                        MessageBox(hwnd, "Hello", "Testing", MB_OK);\n \n                        break; \n                } \n          } \n          break; \n\n\nI suggest that you take a look to the doc of VC++ on these events, mainly in the Windows SDK doc about Buttons. It is well done with code samples.\n\nAdditional note: as you created your button directly on a window instead of within a dialog box, it is very likely that you used a call to the CreateWindow function to create it. In this case, you give the ID number in parameter HMENU hMenu of the function. You may create a Resource ID (it is just an value globally defined with #define) to avoid playing with numbers when you have several controls.\n\nRegards,\nChris.\nhttp://www.beinsoft.com

2	Is it okay to loose body fat while having a cold? before i started my cold (4 days ago) my body fat was %18.18 and today it is %16.94. Before i weighed 108 and now i weigh 105. I am 16 years old (August 25, 1989) and 5'3.\n\ni havn't been eating anything i dont normally eat. I know the normal body fat for my age is 15-24, but going down almost 2% scares me... your cold would have nothing to do with losing that much body fat, my question to you is...if you are 16 WHY in the world are you measuring body fat? you are still growing, dont worry about your percentage. Worry about taking care of yourself to get over your cold, and just stay healthy. My suggestion to you would be even though you are sick, try to eat as much protein as possible, even if its just chicken broth, your body needs protein to create more cells and keep your muscle rather than burn it during a temporary reprieve from eating.

8	my ex continues an emotional relationship w/ me,he has new gf,what's this say about his new relationship? if he never called me  it would be just fine. he calls me and talks for so long . he lives with his girl but he can't seem to completely cut me out of the picture.i don't ever call him or contact him in any way. why does he do this?i have only had sex with him one time since we broke up 8 mths ago, and i refused the other times he asked. but he doesn't seem to care. he still calls to talk and spend time with me. i don't feel the need to tell him not to do those things because it doesn't bother me, it's just confusing since he has a girl. what does this girl mean to him and why does he feel the need to stay in my life. is he cheating on her? He just wants to have a sexual experience with you. If you want a serious relationship, you might have to drop him now. If he's still around, the good guys attracted to you will freak out. You will loose your best opportunity. As a rule, you can't go out with more than a guy at one time. So you have to choose the best guy and spend time with him.

1	Was the Southern Ocean originally called the Antartic Ocean.? And if so when and why was it changed?  I'm sure when I was at school many years ago it was called the latter! The Southern Ocean is the world's fourth largest ocean and the latest to be defined, having been accepted by a decision of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) in 2000, though the term has long been traditional among mariners  Before the year 2000, it was known as the Antarctic Ocean, as you stated.
8	My 15 year old son would not get up and go to school today, so I called the school and they sent an officer? To go to my house and pick him up. I didn't know what else to do.

1	Why do I have to turn off ALL electronic devices when the plane is taking off? Or when it's taxing or landing?\n\nI don't understand how a majority of these devices would interfere at all. One way radios, GPS recievers, laptops w/o wireless, PSPs, etc, etc don't send OUT any signals, so why do we have to turn them off? \n\nEven cell phones that send and recieve, don't they operate at different frequencies from aircraft communications? And isn't the plane already being bombarded with tons of cell phone (broadcast) siganls from outside the plane?\n\nWhat's going to happen if I secretly turn on my cell-phone, and take a call while the fight attendent isn't looking? It gives the flight crew a sense of power to be able to tell you what to do.  The customer is always right... as long as he follows these simple rules...etc.\n\nI don't think cell phones actually cause any problems with plane instruments, but I'm glad they're not allowed.  How annoying would it be to fly from Seattle to NYC on a flight full of people using "cell phone voice."  No, thank you.

I highly recommend this book if you have the willingness to learn and the ability to take control of your health.\n\nBest wishes.

I want to create an image that is I suppose 16 x 22 in size, but I need to do it on two different sheets of paper. I am putting this image on a cake and the edible ink printer can only print 8 x 11 sheets. i thought if I put two together, I can make the image bigger - but I'm not sure how to "split" the image up so that it will print out on two different sheets of 8 x 11 paper. Any ideas? Use Adobe Photo Shop, Print Shop Plus, or Paint. Paint is located under Programs&#92;Accessories, or any other software you might have. Create 2 file folders in the program you chose. Copy the 'full' image into each folder. Open the first folder, determine your 'exact' center-line and erase 1/2 half of the image. Click file and save. Open the other folder, erase the 'other' half of the image and save. Open the first folder, and do your print command. This will print the first half of the image. Open the other folder and again do the print command. This will give you prints of the total image on 2 sheets.

7	who wrote Swan Lake? Swan Lake (Russian: Лебединое Озеро) is one of the most famous and critically-acclaimed ballets, with music by Tchaikovsky.\n\nThe original ballet was first performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia on February 20, 1877 and remained in the repertoire until 1883. After Tchaikovsky's death, the ballet was revised by his brother Modest and the conductor Riccardo Drigo. This revised version received its premiere at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg on January 15, 1895 with choreography by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, and many later stagings have followed their work more or less closely.\n\nA single dancer dances the twin roles of Odette and Odile, which is one of the most taxing of all roles because it requires acting two entirely contrasting characters, as well as the strenuous showpiece dancing itself, including thirty-two fouettés. This feat was put into the choreography because it was a party piece of Pierina Legnani, first prima ballerina assoluta of the Maryinsky ballet. Pavel Gerdt played Prince Siegfried.\n\nThe ballet's premiere in St. Petersburg was very poorly received. It had lackluster costumes and scenery, unusual choreography, and a mediocre orchestra. It also departed from the traditional Russian format of ballet, which used a story with just enough plot to sustain the virtuoso dancing; Tchaikovsky's ballet, on the other hand, included a well-unified storyline which lost much of the audience. A later revival in the year after Tchaikovsky's death was acclaimed as a masterpiece, however, having used phenomenal talent in all aspects.

5	What are the chances that Teddy Hart will get a second chance on either the WWE or TNA? I know he has an attitude problem, but the guy is a natural talent and could very well be the best third generation wrestler yet, even more than The Rock! I mean the guy not only has the great technical and submission skills of the Hart family, but he also has the moves of a luchador. He might actually be better than AJ Styles. Here are some videos of him:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxyLRH6Pbrg\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X9dsUkSqx0\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8p7eaVcMQ\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ukb_YBbs8M\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD2aO6y4NdI\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kiO_lMkYx4\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOhkzc6l_PE\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2rHE5j2Yys\n(The last one is of him showing his interview and mic skills)\n\nI know he already had his shot at WWE (he was the youngest ever to be signed, that's got to say something about him) and TNA, but he is just too good to stay on the independent circuit forever. What do you think? The X-Division whould be a better place for him to start out at. He really could make a good impact there where the X-Division is as much of a main event as the Heavyweights. He then could move over to the WWE. As where the WWE stands right now, he could team up with his cousin Harry Smith. And in addition to that they could fued with DX just like the Hart Foudation did. The storyline pretty much would write itself. \n\nUnfortunately he has had opertunities with both businesses. He prolly will not be signed by the WWE because he didnt not see a lot that they could use him for. He also had a stinct in TNA but he had a bad attitude and TNA didn't tollerate it. So that is def a no. WWE has been known to sign people that I never would have imagined they would sign (both Hardyz for the second time was suprising to me along with Scott Hall in his NWO role). The chances are very slim still though that the WWE will hire him any time soon.

Hi, I personally would not tell my friend.  I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, and sometimes friends don't believe you(don't want to believe it themselves.)

If he continues to come on to you, out of loyalty to your friend, I would tell him what he is doing is not acceptable to you.  Your poor girlfriend.

3	how many years left for sun to start doing the supernovae process? Never!\n\nThe sun is not big enough to become supernova. You need a star of 5-8 times the mass of the sun.\n\nStars like the sun are made of 75% hydrogen, 24% helium and 1% of other stuff. Their cores are hot enough to fuse hydrogen into helium. When the hydrogen in the core is exhausted the star goes through the red giant state in which it fuses helium into heavier elements like oxygen, sulphur all the way up the periodic system upto iron.\n\nFor the sun the red giant state will start in 4-5 billion years. Time enough to move to another star.

5	What is the real difference between a Tasco Riflescope and a Leupold, other than image clarity? I want to know if in reality a cheap scope will affect so much my rifle accuracy to spend $500 - $1000 in a scope.  If they are really so bad what is the difference.\n\nRemember I'm not talking about image quality that I know will be better in a more expensive scope but for Bench Rest Shooting this is not as important as accuracy ( Shoot to Shoot repeatability) Two main differences, both related:\n\nOne, the Tasco scopes usually have 1-inch main tubes and many (most?) Leupolds have 30mm tubes. That extra 5mm means extra elevation adjustment before your stadia (the thing that holds the reticle) hits the side of the scope.\n\nSecondly, the Tasco has two adjustment knobs; one for elevation and one for windage. But the configuration is like this: One knob at 12 o'clock, one at 3 o'clock, and one spring at 7:30 to press the stadia against the adjustment knobs. It's a common configuration, but it means that as you adjust the windage, the elevation can change as well. Leupold uses 2 springs placed 180 degrees from the adjustment knobs - so a knob at 12 and 3, and a spring at 6 and 9. It makes the scope more repeatable as you make adjustments.\n\nIf all you want to do is sight in your rifle at, say, 200 yards and then shoot a deer or two a season, the Tasco will do just fine. if, however, you're dinging clay pigeons at 700 yards with a quartering wind you'll want the scope that can perform for you.\n\nA really simple test of a scope's adjustment mechanism is to shoot a 3-shot group at the center of a large piece of cardboard - right at a target dot. Then move your windage a few minutes of angle to the right - I like to move it 6 minutes, or 24 clicks on a 1/4 moa scope. Place the reticle on the same target dot, and press the trigger 3 times. Now adjust your elevation 6 minutes up and repeat, then 6 minutes left, then 6 minutes down. You should have a perfect square defined by the 5 groups you shot, with the group in the lower left being 6 holes and the others being 3. If you have anything but a square, or your ending group isn't at the same place as your beginning group, your scope has a repeatability problem when adjusted.

5	how can i increase my bench press so i won't get made fun of in the weightroom by my teammates? i want to know do i need to go to the gym or can i jus use the weights in my basement If you've got a bench press in your basement, work on that until you feel comfortable. The first thing you need to do is figure out what weight you max out at (the absolute most you can lift 1 time). Once you've figured that out, your bench workout should be 3-4 sets. \nSet 1) 6 reps of 75% of your max\nSet 2) 6 reps of 80% of your max \nSet 3) 5-6 reps of 85% of your max\nSet 4) 4-5 reps of 85% of your max\nObviously, make sure you have someone spotting you while you do this, because it's not going to be easy, especially the first few times you do it. DO NOT do this two days in a row...make sure you have at least one day off in between so your muscles have time to recover. If the 4th set it too much, then just do the first three. The sets should be difficult, but if they are too much, drop the %'s down by 5%. I'm not a trainer or anything, I just used to lift for football and that's approximately the plan they had us use. Hope it helps.

9	Can anyone type Lincoln's famous speech? Four Score and Seven years ago, our Fathers brought forth on this continent- a new nation - concieved in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\n\nNow we are engaged in a great civil war.  Testing whether that Nation- or any Nation so concieved can long endure.\n\nWe are met on a great battlefield of that war- we have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place of those who gave their lives- that this Nation might live.  It is all together fitting and proper that we should do this.\n\nbut in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow- this ground.  The brave men, living and dead, have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract.  The world will not remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.  It is for us the living, rather, to dedicate ourselves to finishing the work that they so nobly started here.  \n\nIt is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to the cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.\n\nThat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that the government of the people, by the people and for the people, shall not perish from this earth.

One in the living room, done with popcorn, cranberries, and gingham bows. The "main tree" in the dining room, its the biggest, with all of my childrens keepsake ornaments. All three children get a new ornament every year, and my oldest child is 24 so there are lots of ornaments.\nOk now the question. My husband thinks that I decorate too much, my kids love the way the house looks at Christmas. So should I cut back to make hubby happy? Or keep on doing to make kids happy? Me I am just happy that Christmas is coming. What do you think? keep the one with all the keepsakes and the traditionl one in the living room. But dump the master bedroom, tree, that is too much. That way your husband will be happy and so will your kids.\n\non a personal note: I wish my mom would have done the keepsake tree for us,but she is so modern. we have one tree with a different theme each year, we have like 5 different themes,but no tradition.

8	i feel like my relationship with my bf is falling apart what can i do? You haven't explained the reasons why you feel the way you feel.\n\nIf you experience tension in your relationship then I'm sure there are reasons for the same.\n\nAll said, try to analyze your situation and weigh the reasons in the right perspective. \n\nIn case there is something you need to amend to make the difference, then do likewise, else if you think that he needs to amend on his front then discuss the same with him with an aim to salvage your relationship. Do it in an amicable manner so even he would understand the need of doing the same.\n\nIt could also just be that you're going through a lean phase in your relationship and need to let go of your inhibitions as in due course of time things will come back to normal. \n\njust remember that where there is a will there is a way…and if there is a problem, there is also a solution… it’s just about understanding the problem right and you’ll sooner or later come up with the right solution too.\n\nHope you soon get to the crux of things to determine why you feel the way you do and rationally decide to take the right steps to change things where required to salvage your relationship.\n\nWish you all the best.

1	Can a Black light be produced? If not, why? I don't think so.\n\nFirst, one must look at how we see different kinds of colours.  For example, we see a blue-coloured object because the object reflects blue light into our eyes.\n\nA black-coloured object absorbed all lights falling on it and does not reflect any light.  As no light comes into our eyes from the object, it is seen to be black in colour. On this reasoning, you can't produce a black light.
6	what will be the most difficult issues and challenges of the renewble energy of hydrogen? Hydrogen is a red herring. Because it bonds so easily, there's no way to keep a large amount of it.

1	In what orbit does the moon rotate around the sun? We all know from physics that the planets rotate around the sun on an elliptical orbit.But since the moon orbits the earth,which in turn orbits the sun,would its orbit look like a helical spring while observing from the sun? The orbit of the moon is distorted by the earth and vice versa.  The orbits are also distorted slightly by the other planets. However, the distance between the earth and the moon is about 1/400 of the distance from the earth to the sun. Because of that, the moons orbit is always curved towards the sun even though it isn't a perfect ellipse.

5	What does it mean when they talk about the player's caps? On tv, sometimes they'll show the Age and Caps. Explain these caps to me please. Caps - the number of times a player has represented his country's team\n\nA cap is an appearance for the international team for which he is elegible. The term can be applied to any sport and any nationality of player. The term dates from the practice in the United Kingdom of awarding a cap (meaning an item of headgear) to every player in an international match. The practice was first approved on May 10, 1886 for Association Football, after a proposal made by N. L. Jackson, an Old Corinthian:\n\n"That all players taking part for England in future international matches be presented with a white silk cap with red rose embroidered on the front. These to be termed International Caps."\n\nActual caps are not usually given anymore (caps for friendly matches still exist, and each player gets one cap per international competition), but the term "cap" for an international appearance has been retained. Thus, a "cap" is awarded for each game played and so a player who has played x games, for the team, is said to have been capped x times or have won x caps.
1	If you get hit by a hailstone why doesn't it cause serious injury? If a penny falls from the sky and hits someone, it'd probably kill them, and yet a hailstone doesn't even though it's solid ice. Why? Hailstones do cause injury if they're large enough.\n\nSmaller ones are less harmful.  The reason lies in the density and air resistance difference between a penny and a hailstone.\n\nA penny weighs about 3 grams.  A comparable hailstone would have to be at least .75 inches in diameter to be comparable in mass, and will have more wind resistance as it falls.  \n\nCheck out this link regarding hailstone injury
2	I'm very nervous about getting my wisdom teeth removed.  Any advice? I'm getting my teeth removed next Monday, and will be receiving local anasthetic(sp?).  I'm really scared about the procedure.  Any tips?  I have very bad anxiety normally, and I am afraid I'll freak out while they're taking out the teeth.  Also, does anyone know how long the procedure takes if it's not done surgically? Just relax, the technology they have these days really makes it almost painless. I had to have oral surgery because my wisdom's were pushing my teeth inward. I was in the army and they had no oral surgeon. So they just pumped me up with whatever they used, (Novocain?) and with a laser broke the wisdom's and pulled the pieces out. Sounds primitive but I didn't feel a thing. It took two trips, one week apart. It will be ok, just pray the Good Lord guides the hands of the dentist and everything will be smooth sailing.

0	i try to be good with others, but they make fun of me and try to dominate me. What should I do? I never hurt people, yet most people make fun of me and try to dominate me. What should I do to answer them correctly and save my dignity? You should simply not associate with people who make fun of you and try to dominate you.  There's no magic retort which will suddenly turn them into caring considerate people.\n\nIf you find that most people make fun of you and try to dominate you, you might want to look into yourself for the answer.  It could be that you might be misinterpreting their actions.

I work 2 jobs and I'm doing everything I can do to support them, buut it all goes unappreciated. I rarely come home to a dinner, and theres always complaining about things I like to do, like play x-box, or play poker, or just sit and relax.. I cant take it anymore but I dont know what to do... and sex, works for a few days, then its wanted 24/7 which becomes another problem... WHAT DO I DO IM READY TO PACK LOL.. if you love your daughter, that's great, but you shouldn't stay in a relationship for children... it's potentially a noble thought, however, it can turn into resentment due to being miserable for such an extended period of time.. If you love your baby mama, try counseling. Your schedule sounds too hectic- that can be part of the problem... Best of Luck to you and your family!!!!
0	Have you ever said this prayer when you where a child? "Now I lay me down to sleep\nI pray the Lord my soul to keep,\nIf I should die\nBefore I wake,\nI Pray the Lord\nMy soul to Take.\nWhat Exactly does this mean to you? Yes I did say this. I don't think there is anything wrong with speaking about death as far as children are concerned. Death is a part of life and it is only scary if you do not bring God into their life to balance it with hope. Children already in this day and age know about death what they don't know about is God. More children today should pray this prayer. Death should not be swept under the carpet because it happens to everyone.

3	Can u please help me with this personal statement and give some advice on how to edit it...or u may edit it.? During my first year in college, my interest in Science was broadened. There were activities that gave me a brief introduction to the course I'm pursuing like the experiments that weconducted in our Chemistry class and the dissection of frog in our Zoology. The introduction of First Aid gave me a more brief idea on the work of a nurse and it was very useful in times especially when one of my family members needed it most. As I turned into second year college, Iwas introduced to new subjects namely Nutrition, Science Technology and Society and Health Economics which gave me a wider interest in the course that I am taking. Our class did a community service and conducted surveys in our Civic Welfare Training Service Program,and from that experience I learned that it is very heartwaming to listen and assist in the problems of other people. I am happy to provide comfort and help to the troubled and diseased ones.\n\nI usually read Science and Health related books and magazines during my free time and I'm very fond of watching educational shows like Discovery Channel And National Geographic Channel.

(How?) There were activities that gave me a brief introduction to the course I'm pursuing (which is?)like the experiments that we conducted in our Chemistry class and the dissection of frog in our Zoology. The introduction of First Aid (should it be aid or aide?) gave me a more brief (why more brief, I think you should reconsider this statement) idea on the work of a nurse and it was very useful (from here on out this sentence is not clear) in times especially when one of my family members needed it most. (New paragraph) As I turned into second year college, I was introduced to new subjects namely Nutrition, Science Technology and Society and Health Economics which gave me a wider interest in the course that I am taking. Our class did a community service and conducted surveys in our Civic Welfare Training Service Program, and from that experience I learned that it is (very sounds over the top here) very heartwaming to listen and assist in the problems of other people. I am happy to provide comfort and help to the troubled and diseased ones. (those who are troubled and sick sounds better and sick does not have the negative connotations that diseased has)\n\nI usually read Science and Health related books and magazines during my free time and I'm very fond of watching educational shows (if you keep the word "shows" name specific shows not channels) like Discovery Channel (and should not be capitolized) And National Geographic Channel. Badminton is the sport that I play and I also go to the gym once in a while. Scrabble is my favorite board game.

(This whole last paragraph is not useful in determining whether or not to admit you to graduate school)\n\nIt needs to be longer and sound more professional.  At this point it does not sound as if you know anything about the profession for which you are training.  Throw in some jargon from the field.  Remember your audience, you are writing to other professionals, not laypeople.  Tell why you have selected their program and what you'll bring to the program.  Tell about research interests.

I would say its more than adequate, most LCD's are these days plus its an 19"inch screen so it will look very nice and has a maximum resolution size of 1280 x 1024. So it should be fine for playing games, watching films and word processing.\n\nHope this helps!!

8	Wife and I are considering an open marriage. Would I feel the same about if she came home full of a mans seed? I think that this would be a mistake.  I know that my husband occasionaly says things about a 3-way, but in the end he would have a problem with it.  He would hate knowing that another man has touched me that way.  I don't think he would be able to look at me the same way.
3	What do you call the different divisions in an act of a play? Scene
0	what kinda girls do guys find hot? hot - now how do you define it? physical and beyond ;) and how's the hottest girl you know like? "Hotness" is very subjective. Every person's tastes differ. Personally, I've always had a bit of a thing for redheads and Asians, but I've been completely struck by a couple women who didn't fall into either category, so easily. Physically, every man can debate whatever physical trait they find aesthetically pleasing, but I think that there's one personality trait that's universal: CONFIDENCE.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing sexier than a truly confident, self-assured woman. One of my ex-girlfriends I dated for three years, and I loved her, but she was so cripplingly, self-deprecating, that it truly ruined our relationship. You can only compliment someone and assure them so many times before you let their negativity destroy you. Apparantly three years was pretty much my limit, and I'll never make that mistake again. If you've got a healthy dose of self-esteem and you exude that (but don't flaunt it to the point of narcissism), we come running.

6	What is the best home loan for self employed with a fica score of 730? That depends upon the rest of your profile, and your needs. I work with a large number of self-employed borrowers, and their profiles are all over the map. Some "hide" there income, so for them I use a stated income loan, or no ratio loan (income is not considered in the underwriting).\n\nOthers are signed personally on their business credit cards, and have large monthly debt services - even though it is the company's, and not theirs.\n\nHowever, others have such a stong profile, - good income, assets, credit scores, that the loan is simple.\n\nYou will have to provide more information for me to be more helpful.

5	glock 19 for home defense? i was researching a gun for home defense and came upon a page talking about how glock pistols are so easy to use (automatic safeties).  thats not all good if you think about it. what if the gun got into the wrong hands? it would be easy for your own gun to be pointed and shot at you with ease. (robber grabs it befor you) i've heard that some thieves who got hold of someones gun couldnt get a shot off because they didnt know how to work it (safeties, loading..) so it makes glock seem like a bad idea for home defense. can you suggest a better home defense gun to me? what caliber? I am a retired police officer with over 20 years experience in the New Orleans area.  In that time, I have never had a case where the presence of a weapon made any real difference in what took place at your "average" burglary.  Meaning a random burglary where an armed homeowner was present in no way influenced the crimes outcome.  Yes, I have had homeowners shooting at potential burglars but for the most part, burglars when confronted don't stick around.  Of course, there are exceptions.  \n\nMy point is that for the average homeowner having weapons in the house is merely a "feel" good measure and does not offer any kind of deterrent to a burglar.  Residences that are known to have weapons can ultimately become "targets" because the criminal is looking for those weapons.  And believe me, burglars have ways of finding out if you have a cache of weapons.\n\n\nTo answer your question, while it is true that Glocks are "good to go" and could be used against you by an attacker, the opposite is also true for other "more complicated" handguns.  In stressful situation such as a home invasion, if you are not well trained on the weapon's use, you could very well forget to release the safety yourself and thus become a victim anyway.   \n\nIt is well documented that in some police shootings, the police officers were killed with their weapons in hand with the safeties still engaged.  In fact some departments switched to Glocks for that very reason.  If you are concerned about the Glock, you could always leave the first round out of the chamber which would then require you to pull the slide back before firing thus acting as a safety and giving you more time to react if the intruder takes you weapon away.\n\nI think that there are always variables beyond your control and to worry whether or not to keep a Glock or a Berretta (which can be complicated to operate) is a moot point.  \n\nSomeone else suggested a shotgun.  It is the same scenerio.  You would have to release the safety before you could "protect" yourself and I have seen countless times in shotgun training.  Police officers jump out their units to engage a target and 50% of them will forget to release the safety.  I have done it myself.  It is a horrible feeling to pull the trigger and have nothing happen.  Not to mention embarassing when theirs 20 other policer officers staring at you!\n\nMy advise is to reconsider arming yourself, especially if you have a family.  There is also a liability issue to consider should you harm someone other than the burglar.  Rounds don't stop at you front lawn!  \nIf you must have a weapon take the responsibility to train and become proficient with it's use regardless of the make and model.  If you choose the glock, leave the first round out of the chamber but keep the magazine loaded.  As far as what caliber, if you goal is to shoot to kill, don't get anything smaller than a .40 cal.  If you want to wound and maybe get lucky and kill em go for a 9mm.\n\nThat's just my opinion!
1	what is the origin of the folding rule? 2000 YEARS OF WORLD HISTORY \nThe "Historical Folding Rule" visualizes history on two different levels. \nThe Event Side\nOn the event side, each centimeter represents ten years of world history. It recalls significant data from the Roman times until the Millenium, from Jesus Christ to the Internet. \nThe Periods Side \nThe periods side presents world history divided into its fundamental periods. Entries on intellect, powers, and the arts on a backdrop ranging from LATE ANTIQUITY until the MODERN TIMES provide a context for individual events. \nOther than conventional history books the "Historical Folding Rule" elucidates historical correlations in an extraordinary way: it provides a synthesis of clarity, keen intellect and wit.

4	WHat is the difference between Adobe Acrobat And Reader? I know this question has been asked before, but I would liek some detail.  I have a computer I bought second hand, with Adobe Acrobat 8 installed on it.  I also have Adobe Reader 7.0.5 on it, or maybe 7.0.8, not sure.  Anyway, I would liek to free up some space, and I dont even know if I really NEED both or even either of these, especially if I use another PDF viewer, like foxit, which is MUCH MUCH smaller.... You don't say whether your "8" is the ENTIRE program or just the reader, but in any case it is a NEWER version than your old one; so delete the old one, you do NOT need both.\n\nIf it IS the complete version, this lets you make PDF files, as well as read the files and I would keep it!!

2	why doesn't uhc cover elidel? First, most employers outsource their Rx benefits. That means another company, not UHC, decides what is covered and what is not as well as what your cost will be (i.e Medco, Caremark, Express Scripts, etc...).\n\nSecondly, if your diagnosis doesn't match the AMA standards for this medicine no insurance company will approve it. This medication is also being reviewed as a potential cancer risk by the FDA and is only currently recommended if all other treatments have failed.\n\nOf course $$$ is also an issue and if there are other similar medications available, denying this particular one is a way to force you to choose a more economical medication. This is a tier 3 (most expensive-brand name non-formulary) medication, as recently as late May/early June it had been tier 2 (cheaper-brand name). Are you sure it is not covered or is it that the price has doubled?\n\nTalk to your physician about alternatives. Good luck!

Johnny Warren Born May 17th 1943 yes he did play only in one game in 1974 World Cup a match against East Germany which Australia lost 2-0 & he did hurt his foot which meant he missed the two remaining games, Australia`s single point came from a   0-0 draw with Chile.

He died on November 6th 2004 only days after the launch of       A-League Australia`s new top level Soccer Camp,  which meant he missed the kick off in 2005. Hope this is what you wanted.

2	Does getting a filling hurt? I think I need to get a filling in one of my teeth, but I’ve never had one before and I’m a bit worried about it. I don’t want to ask any of my mates about it because they’ll take the mickey out me if they know I’m scared about getting a filling!!! Does it hurt? I know it’s not supposed to hurt after you get the injection, but how bad is the injection? Do you always have to get an injection for a filling or could I get it done without? And how long does it take for a filling? Cheers. I'm a dentist.\n\nRead these words carefully:\n\nThere is procedure that your dentist performs that should cause you pain.  The only thing that should hurt is the injection of local anesthetic, which, if done properly, should hurt only minimally.\n\nOnce profound anesthesia of the tooth has been obtained, you should only sense the vibration of the drill and the air/water in your mouth.  There should be no pain.\n\nI cannot tell you, however, how long the procedure will take.  It depends on the extent of the decay, the number of tooth surfaces involved, the doctor's experience, the restoration material to be used, the quality of the doctor's assistant, your ability to open your mouth wide and keep your mouth opened wide (more on this below), and the extent to which you salivate.  Generally, on a good patient, placing a two-surface amalgam filling takes me about ten to fifteen minutes.  A two surface composite (i.e. tooth-colored) filling runs about twenty minutes.  A fidgety patient who repeatedly closes his/her mouth will require more time.\n\nOne of the things that patients do to make our job difficult is not open their f-ing mouths wide.  You tell them "open wide" and they'll open wide for two seconds before closing half way again.  The less you open, the less we can see, which understandibly means that the quality of our work is less.  When your doctor says "open wide", that means you should open wide and keep your mouth opened wide until he/she tells you to close.  It's in your best interest to do so.

4	Give atleast 5 Hardware...And Explain....? help me with this guys! pls... 1. : The main circuit board containing the vital components of a PC such as the processor & the RAM. - A circuit board or "logic board" inside the computer that contains the central processing unit (CPU), microprocessor support chips, RAM, and slots for adding expansion boards such as audio, scanner, SCSI, and video boards. Multimedia chips such as DSP audio and video chips will increasingly be put on the motherboard rather than on expansion boards. \n\n\n2. CPU: Central Processing Unit that encompasses a computer's RAM, processing, and control circuitry, including the arithmetic-logic (ALU) unit. Both the ALU and the control units are wholly contained on the microprocessing chip whereas the primary storage is on the mother board or the expansion bus.\n\n3. Hard Drive: The hardware which performs the basic operations on the hard disk - including rotating the disk & reading/writing data to the disk. \n\n4. Monitor: The Monitor is used to display the images which are generated by a PC'sVideo Adaptor . \n\n5. Keyboard: The Keyboard is the main device that we use for entering data into a PC or giving it an instruction to do something specific. The key arrangements resemble that of a traditional typewriter plus lots more additional keys for specific functions.
6	Am I liable for taxes as a cosigner? I cosigned with my mom to get a house about 10 years ago. She refinanced a few years back and we thought my name was no longer on it but last week it was discovered that I'm still on the title. Now she is selling the house, my concern is, with the profit she is making from the house--will I be liable for any part of it on my income taxes since my name is on the title? If you are on the title to the property...YES.\n\nNot if you are only a co-signer on the loan.\n\nYou can deduct 250k from home sale profits once every 5 years. Just have her use this total deduction (actually home sale profit) on her taxes. You can also "split" the profit any way you like on the taxes but...have her take it, you may sell in a couple years and need it.\n\n==================================

8	I need advice about girls. I need a pen pal who can give me advice regarding girlfriends. Please help.? Here's what happens - I meet a girl whom I like, we talk, we go out and we become friends. She calls we make plans, we go out several times. I have no bad intentions (really).\nI am looking for a serious relations - not a one night stand or things like that. I'm polite and respectful.\nThen comes the change - they stop calling etc etc. So, I also stop, then they start again. I really don't understand, I am not here to play games. This has happened to me a number of times with a number of girls - thats why I think it must be that I am doing something wrong, thats the problem. It is really very frustrating. Any advice - anyone. if your the serios one in the relationship, then your not doing absolutely anything wrong. trust me... therefore if its not you, then its definetly the slutty chicks your seeing. im not a play girl, i usually stick to serious relationships and dont go around calling and then not calling, so trust me, its not you, its simply the non worthy ones.

4	which can i choose for my laptop AMD *2/ INTEL CORE 2 DUO? dear sir/mam,\n        i m here planed to buy an laptop which procrssor i have to relay upon eaither amd duo core /intel duo core.....i prefer amd but somebody telling that it produces heat so it is not the best option please claryfy my doughts.\n                                 thank you. Most of the people on this board are preteens and teens that have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to microprocessors.\n\nThe best processor available now is Intel's Core 2 Duo...period. This may change in time, however, as it stands right now, the Core 2 Duo is best. Anyone telling you otherwise is just an uniformed teeny bopper.\n\nPeople telling you that AMD processors run hot are beyond clueless. That USED to be the case years ago, way before the Athon 64. Until just recently (until Core Duo) AMD processors ran much COOLER than Intel processors, as excess heat was one of the reasons the Pentium line was scrapped. Now, in terms of heat generation, they're close to the same, with a slight edge going to AMD.\n\nIf you really want an AMD Turion system for your laptop, by all means get one, as they're not bad...just not quite as good at this time as Intel's offering. This may not remain the case though in the second half of 2007, when AMD updates its line.

6	im 22 years old and I look like a 32 years old man and i have lost some hair as well.. what shd I do...? Take the opportunity for people to assume you are more mature than your 22 years of life.  You can approach people and be taken more seriously.  Don't try to cover up hair loss.  Do not, I repeat, DO NOT attempt the "comb over".  It has never, does not, and will never work!  Crop it short and live with it.  It really doesn't bother most women as much as most men are consumed with it!  Just don't try to "stretch it".\n\nWalk with confidence, and put the emphasis on some feature that you like, rather than expend all the energy on something you can't control or really fix!
5	Pourquoi le Tour est la course cycliste la plus médiatisée? Certes c'est la course la plus dure au Monde. J'ai participé à la Vuelta cette année et ce n'est pas si médiatisé que ça. Pourquoi? Le Tour est si médiatisé parce que c'est la course qui réunit les meilleures équipes et les meilleurs coureurs du monde. Pour la Vuelta ou le Giro, seuls les espagnols et les italiens envoient leurs meilleurs éléments. Sur le Tour, les leaders de chaque équipe toute nationalité confondue sont présents.\n\nLe fait que la course se déroule en juillet est aussi un avantage pour ASO. Les spectateurs sont plus nombreux et les télespectateurs aussi. Pour les deux autres GT, il est difficile de les suivre quand on travaille. Donc il y a moins d'audience et la couverture médiatique stagne.\n\nDe plus, on entend souvent dire que c'est sur le Tour que se sont forgés les plus belles légendes. Et en général, je pense que l'on retient mieux les vainqueurs sur le Tour que ceux sur le Giro ou la Vuelta à long terme.\n\nEnfin, et çà il n'y a que toi qui pourra me le confirmer, l'objectif / le rêve de tout coureur n'est-il pas de remporter une étape sur le Tour ou mieux de s'y imposer?
0	Help with gay marriage in new jersey? I just recently moved to the uk from living in the states to marry my partner, we both now want to move back to the states and live together in new jersey where i lived my whole life. Can you please help with info or where i can get all the info we need to make the move to the states. We currently have a uk civil partnership. Thanks for you time... As of now, there is no gay marriage in New Jersey. On October 25, 2006 New Jersey's Supreme Court ruled that homosexuals are entitled to the same rights as heterosexuals, but gave the state legislature 180 days to decide if those same rights would be in the form of a civil union or a marriage. Due to this ruling, New Jersey can either be like Massachusetts and recognize gay marriage or like Vermont and Connecticut and recognize civil unions. It is important to note that, even though a few states recognize either civil unions or marriage that those laws only apply to those individual states; there is NO RECOGNITION of either gay marriage or civil unions by the US Federal Government. \n\nMassachusetts is the only US state to recognize gay marriage. Vermont and Connecticut recognize civil unions. California has a domestic partnership law that provides most (but not all) spousal benefits to unmarried couples. Hawaii, Maine, and the District of Columbia have laws that provide partial benefits to unmarried couples.
2	how do i know if my partner is suffering from manic depression or bipolar disorder following babys birth? It is called post-partem depression. It is a serious illness that can lead to unwanted thoughts and could cause your wife harm. She needs to be evaluated by a psychiatrist and then be referred to a psychologist as soon a s possible. There is a lot of information about post-partem depression on the internet. My suggestion would be to check it out at webmd.com,and see if the symptoms that are listed there are what you are seeing in your wife's behavior. Also,if she will not go to see someone,then you need to go for her and find out what you can do to help her. I strongly advise that she be seen though. Good luck. Zoya.

Beta-Stage is also know as testing-stage.\n\nIn Web-Pages u can see it like that:\n\nPre-Alpha: U think about what's going to be on your page\nAlpha: The basic structure is built, without any further functions or just few functions.\nBeta: Most of the functionality of your page is up and running, your friends can have a first look on it and maybe test the Forum or so...\nRelease: Its opened for business :D\n\n(For those who do not know: Alpha, Beta ... comes from the greek alphabet (<- the word "Alphabet" also does), where the first letters are "Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma" ...
1	acetylene gas is produced from calcium carbide and water.If 32 g of calcium carbide are consumed, how many g ? grams of water are needed?\nthank you everybody..... The balanced reaction is:\nCaC2 + 2H2O ---> C2H2 + Ca(OH)2\n\nThe molar mass of CaC2 is 64 g/mol so you are starting with 0.5 moles of calcium carbide.  Since water reactions with CaC2 is a 1:2 ratio, you will need twice as much water, or 1.0 moles of water = 18 grams of water.

Unfortunately,  I missed my palm & used only my wrist to hit it.\n\nStraight away a lump formed on my wrist and by god it hurt.  My vein fekt like it was gonna pop out!!!\n\nIt is not broke as I can move all my fingers and type without any problems.  It hurts when I try to grip things and the lump has not gone down.  It is strated to bruise and I have a tingling sensation down the left side of my wrist.\n\nI don't want to wait in A&E for 5 hours as it will be full of drunk football fans & sunburnt kids.\n\nAny idea of what I could have done? Funny you should say that you hit it like a volleyball, I had this same injury from a volleyball. My diagnonsense,...in simple terms I bruised the bones, pinched a nerve (thus that lovely tingling sensation that will abate after a day or so), and broke a cluster of blood vessels, thus the resulting lump.  Do not fear, it will heal, but it will be mildly painful and aggravating for the next week or so depending on how fast you heal,...I found that putting an ace bandage on it worked fairly well to keep me from strainign it. \n\n  And as with most things like this, the injury will fade, but the embarrasment seldom does,...hope you had better luck then me and just hurt your arm,...because at the time of my injury I dived for the volleyball and my pants split straight up the back,...hehehe
2	My doctor says my kidneys are hot.  What does that mean? He says my system is out of balance (yin vs yang)  He prescribes Temper Fire or 9 Flavor Tea Pills.  I get dizzy if I don't take them.  Have had this condition for 20 years and this is the only thing that helps.  Any other people have this condition and what do you suggest. Liver and Kidney Yin Vacuity \nThis pattern appears as the combined Yin deficient symptoms of both the Liver and Kidney, and is common in depleted or older patients. Aging, reproduction, and excessive sexual activity deplete the Kidney, while the stresses of life and emotional challenges tax the Liver. Together, the diminishment of these two vital substances is responsible for numerous natural phases such as menopause, and the overall aging process. Deficient Yin of these combined organs will result in dryness of all their associated bodily tissues, including the skin, hair, eyes, and diminishment of sexual fluids. As the Liver rules the eyes, visual problems such as loss of acuity, blurry vision and dry eyes result. As the Kidneys rule the ears hearing problems, such as tinnitus or hearing loss develop. Other symptoms include dizziness, dry mouth and throat, seminal emission, insomnia, and low back or knee ache. Also included will be heat signs due to Empty Fire rising out of Yin vacuity, such as warmth in the palms of the hands, soles of the feet or the chest center. The tongue will be red, possibly with cracking, and have little coating. The pulse will be fine and weak.

9	why is 3rd world countries water so contaminated? Because they dont have water filters to purify thier water. All thier waste gets dumped into local rivers, streams, or lakes, and without a pump or purification system they are forced to drink the water to survive even though the water is so contaminated with parasites, fungus, and hundreds of diseases. The contaminated water, in most 3rd world countries, also makes it almost impossible to find any food or animals around the water sources.

2	My husband hit me and i'm not sure what to do? we have a healthy relationship otherwise, we both ae well educated andlive a comfortable life, he was really stressed and i told him i would make dinner, but i came home ate from med school and i fell asleep. he feels really bad, i'm pretty mad too.....maybe i should have hit him back.... I know the feeling.  I went to nursing school and my children were lucking to get a home cooked meal.  My youngest father bite the shit out of me one day.  We were together for five years.  I forgave him and that was that.  Then one day he came at me again and before I was able to do any more damage I punched him so hard in the eye he could barely see.  We split up after that.  Then four years later he marries and I was talking to his wife.  Without me saying anything she told me about how she has bite marks all over his body.  \n\nI would give him a second chance.  You are just as stressed out as he is.  He could have walked out the door and bought you guys some dinner.  He should understand that when entering med school there is barely enough time for yourself.  You eat, breath and sleep med, med terms, and everything else involved.\n\nIf he tries again I suggest giving it right back to him.  It will surprise him and get him thinking that you don't allow that.\n\nGood luck in school

1	what do you call the equipment that brings back the heartbeat of a person? it can be seen on different TV shows or movies...\nit is also used when a patient is soon to die... A defibrillator is a medical device used in the defibrillation of the heart. It consists of a central unit and a set of two electrodes. The central unit provides a source of power and control. The two electrodes are placed directly on or in the patient. The device is designed to deliver an electric shock to the patient, in an effort to stop ventricular fibrillation.  Ventricular fibrillation is a cardiac condition that consists of a lack of coordination of the contraction of the muscle tissue of the large chambers of the heart that eventually leads to the heart stopping altogether.\n\nAs you can see the defibrillator doesn't actually start a stopped heart, it only corrects the poor pumping action of the heart.

It has to grow to keep from drying out and rotting. \n\nNails provide support and protect the end of the finger.\n\nIf the bone grew all the way to support the tip, it would be much too easy to actually puncture the skin with the bone if you gripped something very hard.\n\nWithout a fingernail the tip of the finger would be rubbery soft and so flexible it would be hard to pick things up or hang onto them.  \nI know because I lost a fingernail once and it was so rubbery it felt weird and there was no strength in the tip of it.....

9	Withdrawing our troops from Iraq? Do you agree the quick extraction will be okay? New democrat congress suggested the new time table for getting out of Iraq. I was told, it is pretty much evacuating the allied troops very soon.\n\nBut according to today's news, Top U.S. army general in  the mid east, John Abizaid, disagrees with it.\n\nHe instead emphathized on strengthening Iraqi government on standing up its own feet.\n\nAbizaid's argument was that if we leave right now, there will be worse violence and chaos.\n\n\nSo, it looks like we can not get out Iraq anytime soon. And this will suck up our nation's energy, money, human resources, and in my opinion, this prolonged Iraq occupation will cause the U.S. to lag behind its internal development (ex: catching up the technology, funding the school systems, building more hospitals, helping out the disadventaged, etc.) to the other rising countries like China, etc.\n\nWhat is your idea on how long will the U.S. stay in Iraq, and what needs to be done to ready for the U.S. leave? \n\nI want to hear your strategy. We should withdraw them as soon as possible. I know that many people want a phased withdrawal lasting something like 18-24 months. Abizaid also warns against a quick pullout. Here is the bottom line: if we left a year ago there would be a civil war, if we leave tomorrow there will be a civil war, if we leave in a year there will be a civil war. When we leave there will be massive bloodshed, no way to avoid it. There is really no point now in risking more American lives when the outcome is certain.

5	will rooney make world cup? Wayne Rooney has no chance of figuring in England's group matches at the World Cup but could be ready for the knockout stages, according to sports injury expert Roger Roberton.\n\nRooney broke the fourth metatarsal in his right foot during Manchester United's 3-0 defeat by Chelsea on Saturday, sparking fears he could miss the entire tournament which begins in 40 days.\n\n"Wayne is young and has a good team around him. The main thing is he mustn't do any hard-impact exercise," Roberton told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme.\n\n"It's better for him to swim. Being young it can take between four and six weeks for this injury to repair properly.\n\n"He must build up gradually the amount of exercise he does and have rest days between sessions. When running 40 or 50% of the body's weight is put on the metatarsal's head.\n\n"He should rest and not do much exercise and should be back to normal in four to six weeks.\n\n"I would doubt very much if he could make the first game, or even the second, of the group stages. I would say he can be back in seven weeks. I would build up between four and five weeks."\n\nSPORTINGLIFE>COM

0	Did we really not know the levies would break in New Orleans?  How can we predict other natural disasters? Of course we'd known that the levies would break; in fact, the President had the information about a more powerful hurricane destroying the levees, yet he chose not to develop any emergency planning. The levees themselves were only built to withstand a Category 2 or possibly Category 3 hurricane. We can definitely predict that these disasters will happen, with advanced computer models and other new technologies.
5	im looking for a ballpark figure as to what the value of my  1890 winchester 22 rifle might be? this is a winchester 22 rifle model 1890 it also has pat.june25,1988 to dec.6 1892 it takes 22 longs and has a octagon barrell The Winchester Model 1890 was manufactured from 1892 -1932 with 849,00 made. I'm assuming that this is a Takedown model with blue finish which is the most commonly found example. If it is one of the 2 earlier models, it would be worth considerably more. All are very collectible. \n\n98% condition $1000\n95%                  $900\n90%                  $800\n80%                  $700\n70%                  $600\n60%                  $500\n50%                  $400\n40%                  $350\n30%                  $300\n20%                  $275\n10%                  $235\n\nAs you can see condition is everything. Most of these guns saw lots of use, 95 - 98% guns are rare.\n\nAdded\nJohn K has kinda muddied the waters here a bit, so I'm going to clarify a few things. \nThe Model 1890 First Model Solid Frame had a case hardened receiver and was manufactured 1890 -1892. There were only 15,000 made and are quite rare and very valuable. \nValues are:\n98% condition $10,000\n90% $7000\n80% $6000\n70% $4500\n50% $3500\n30% $2500\n\nModel 1890 Second Model Takedown Frame had a color case hardened receiver The takedown feature was added in 1892 when the solid frame were discontinued. The serial # range on this model was 15,500 to 326,000. \nThe values are:\n98% $4250\n95% $3750\n90% $3000\n80% $2750\n70% $2250\n50% $1500\n30% $800\n\nI can not stress enough, condition is every thing.

3	What is the difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree? One difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree are the requirements. To gain eligibility for a Bachelors, you must have at least a GED and have scored well enough on the SAT. To be eligible for a Masters Degree, you must have completed a Bachelors degree program, and adequate scores on the GRE.\n\nIn addition, as a Bachelors degree student, your first year or two focuses on the acquisition of general knowledge and the last few years become more specialized, focusing primarily on classes for your major/minor area. \n\nIn contrast, the Master's degree program takes usually only 2 years to complete and the student is only focused on learning one speciality area during that time. In addition, a Masters program requires the student to be more of an independent learner, with classes requiring much more research and independent thought.

Marijuana is the only plant classified as a controlled substance, I believe, but it is certainly not the only plant that may not be imported or possessed.   It remains illegal in most countries.  Even in the Netherlands where it is openly smoked in coffee shops, that is only by benign neglect and it is still illegal in the Netherlands.

1	thank you for quick response,however im still at aloss.how do the atoms in a pencil for example"know" know that it is part of the eraser and not the metal fastner or the wood or the black ink in the name stamped inthe side?if they are constantly in motion why doesnt the pencil not begin to blur and dissisipate? .  The atoms in the pencil are in motion, but not freely in motion.  The atoms are bound up in molecules which make up crystaline or cellular structures.  The metal atoms in the eraser holder are part of the metal crystaline matrix.  The carbon and other atoms of the eraser are parts of organic molecules which form strands which are interlinked.  The carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms of the wood are parts of cellulose molucules which formed the cell wall of the tree from which the wood was taken.  The "lead" of the pencil contains carbon molecules in fractured crystals of graphite, which are mixed with clay, which contains silicon, aluminum and oxygen in a crystaline structure.\n.  If you picture a ping pong ball tethered by a weak rubber band and knocked around by a mild shifting breeze, the ping pong ball would be "free" to move, but the rubber band would keep it moving about the same center.  A stronger breeze might have enough energy to break the rubber band and let the ping pong ball be blown wherever the wind goes.\n.  Atoms are of just the size that puts them on the brink of quantum mechanical uncertainty.  They are large enough that the uncertainty about their position is very small, even when their energy is know to a high degree of precision.  In quantum mechanics, this means that the amount they will wander is quite small, small enough that they remain bound to their neighbors in their molecular or crystaline arrangements.  Adding energy in the form of heat both increases the uncertainty about their position and increases the probability that their bonds will be broken.
8	help me please another stupid question? ok my bf told me that he might be moving to west virginia which where i live isn't very far(all i gotta do is cross a bridge)but if he moves we won't going to the same school and i hate having long distance relationships!!!!!!!!!!!I mean i am really getting attached to this guy! i mean head over heels in love and knowing that hes going to move and not knowing when it hurts to know hes gonna leave me and one day i might not see him again.I mean when he leaves if he don't have a chance to tell me hes leavin what am i supposed to do????? excuse the other folks' rude answers.  it sounds like you are very worried about this.  do yourself a favor and relax.  do  you think maybe he's just telling you that to see if you'll tell him how much you care about him?  or do you  know for a fact his family may be planning to move there?  could be just a head game, i don't k now you guys' ages.  so many things we worry about never even happen, relax.  if in fact he does move, and  you find yourself with a broken heart, just try to keep really busy with your friends and family.  if you two are meant to be together it will happen t hat way.  and if not, you will fall in love with someone else and forget all about him if it'snot meant to be.  good luck

2	what is fatty liver? If you have fatty liver, it can be from drinking heavily or drinking massive amounts of soda.  Most soda uses high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar, this leads to fatty buildup in the liver. Children are more prone to this these days because the soda companies switched from regular fructose to high fructose corn syrup.  If you suspect you have fatty liver, the non alcoholic type NASH or the alchoholic kind, you should have your liver enzymes checked and have your liver looked at on a sonogram.
3	college degree no job? does anyone else have a college degree and cant get a job? I have a degree in broadcasting and cant catch a break! I was like that for almost 2 years. The only piece of advice I can give is this:  Don´t underestimate connections. Ask anyone you now. Even if you have to start low, take it, and build up from there. If you don´t have connections, then try to make them. It is easier once you hace any kind of job. If you have little or no social skills, then get yourself a friend that does and ask your friend to help you or even go with you.  Also, very important: Change your mental state. Develop a positive attitude.  Good luck!

3	We can't change a person cuz we are not God. As teachers, are we doing enough for just being extra patience? I did spend 18 months to work with a teen boy for drawing his life-chart. But, what he's been craving for is to enjoy an early romance with any girls who likes him. I'm really fed up with his way of thinking. He hates me a lot for trying to change him. He even insulted me for getting too much involved with his private life. It's not your job to change people. It is your job to teach and guide them. As  a teacher you should be open to having your students come and talk to you if they choose so. Sometimes a child feels they don't have anyone to go to and as a teacher you should be able to guide them in the right direction even if it be another person to help them. A child spend alomost as much time if not more at school then at home. The parents have no choice but to trust that you are going to put some heart into your job as well as the books. So no I don't think that extra patience is enough to be honest. It is not your job to give out dating advice nor is it your business to be getting involved in such a private aspect of the childs life unless it is extreme and the parents need to be told. Most teens want to date, and they are not mature enough to be looking for "the one" but it is part of growing up. You get paid to teach yes but you also get paid to listen to your students and helo them when they are in need. Knowing that i have to put my son into school in a few years scares me, simply because anymore teachers don't care. They simply want to go in open the books and go home. Children need to be guided through the years and if you work in a postion where you are going to be a huge part of that childs daily life then you are just as responible for some of the outcome. If a child is being abused it is your job to say something about it or contact the proper authorities, but it is not your job to get involved in private aspects of thier lifes otherwise unless they show you that it is ok for you to do so. Some people are open and some are more private. I had a few great teachers growing up that made a huge difference in my life and it didn't come from what they taught in class in came from the heart.

0	does witch craft realy work and how can i get into it? Depends on how you define "work".  \n\nIf you are looking for something that will fix all your problems, give you power over others, or make you fly around the room, then no, it does not "work".\n\nIf you're looking for an earth-based spirituality that can give you a sense of place in the world around you, and help you define yourself, your relationships, and the world around you, then it might be a good fit.  If you're looking for a system that believes in possibility or the impossible, or belives that what often gets called "supernatural" is perfectly natural, then it might be right for you.  \n\nYou can get into it by reading some books, visiting some websites, and most importantly enough, finding Wiccans or Neo-pagans in your area to connect with.
5	Who will win 2night, Celtics or Nets? Nets are playing sixers \n\nCeltics are playing pacers\n\n       Sixers are currently winning and I believe they will win because they need this game if Indiana and Milwaukee and Chicago lose then Sixers go from 9th seed to a tie breaker for sixth. Its gonna be hard to beat the nets though \n\n       I hope Celtics win. So Sixers can get a higher seed\n\n      Edit:    Sixers winning by 21 at half sorry to all the players who say that Nets have better record. I know you guys were thinking a different team but sixers almost have the same record as Celtics. And not as much depth as Nets. But sixers need it and are winning it. 3 in a row.

9	If Martial Law Was Declared in the United States, could the the president suspend a national election ? United States of America\nThe martial law concept in the U.S. is closely tied with the Writ of habeas corpus, which is in essence the right to a hearing on lawful imprisonment, or more broadly, the supervision of law enforcement by the judiciary. The ability to suspend habeas corpus is often equated with martial law. Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution states, "The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."\n\nIn United States law, martial law is limited by several court decisions that were handed down between the American Civil War and World War II. In Ex Parte Milligan 71 US 2 1866, the Supreme Court of the United States held that martial law could not be instituted within the United States when its civilian courts are in operation. In 1878, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval. The National Guard is an exception, since unless federalized, they are under the control of state governors. [5]

3	Geometry questions.. please help!? Okay so i have two problems which i dont know how to do:\nUse the pythogorem therum to figure out the distance between the two points.\n1. E(-2,-1),F(3,11)\n2. G(-2,-6),H(6,9)\n\n\nCould you please explain it to me. The pythagorean theorem is c^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nWhich means if you drew a straight line between the two points, you would have "c", which is the long side of a right triangle.  "a" and "b" form the sides.\n\nSo in your first example, -2 and 3 represent the "width", or horizontal edge, of your triangle.  Subtract the smaller value from the larger to get the length:\n\na = 3 - (-2)\na = 5\n\n-1 and 11 represent the "height", or vertical edge:\n\nb = 11 - (-1)\nb = 12\n\nSo your equation is this:\nc ^ 2 = a ^ 2 + b ^ 2\nc ^ 2 = 5 ^ 2 + 12 ^ 2\nc ^ 2 = 25    + 144\nc ^ 2 = 169\nc = 13\n\nSo the distance between E and F is 13.

2	What age do Guys start to ejaculate? I'm 13 years old and when i ejaculate only semen(or watever the clear sticky stuff is) comes out. i want to know how much longer until sperm starts to come out when i ejaculate Well, I'll try to be clear. Yes, it's semen (and only it!)\nThat event is called male orgasm and it occurs when the excitment reaches the apex. Mind sends signal and from Prostate and Testicles (and from other glans too) semen begins to come out (through the urethra). It's a fast event lasting few seconds even. And after 1 -2 min. penis become flabby again. I hope to have satisfied your question.
9	V for Vendetta and our present government? For those of you that saw the movie, do you think that it's message of non conformity should be implemented in the US? Non-conformity?\n\nAre you suggesting that chaos is a much better fashion statement than organization (although I firmly believe that chaos itself is an order.)\n\nAlthough I haven't seen the movie, a good friend of mine did and raised this same question to me. My response is now as it was then...\n\nThe major problem that we are facing as earthlings is our seeming inclination to NOT take responsiblity for our own actions. Because of our society's inability to do as such, we are left with one of two choices: 1) Let people do as they please and allow society to become a land of goons and selfish, self-righteous individuals who care not about their society... or 2) Control every facet of life so that people who choose not to make responsible decisions are made to pay...\n\nAgain, brother, the problem is not that people are unable to make their own decisions, it is that people don't appear to be willing to take responsiblity for those decisions, thus leading to other's distress...\n\nI believe, personally, from things that I have learned, encountered, and dealt with in this truly exciting experience that we call "Life," that freedom truly is free if we all assume it. However, people are not all alike and sadly, we are left to the majority of opinion controlling our society. Because of that, there are people who are left dissatisfied. \n\nThis dissatisfaction leads to unrest. Unrest of one, leads to manipulation of more to regain a sense of control to bring about change. From there comes the usage of the most controlling item to balance the scales (in this case MONEY). Once that is achieved, anyone with this sort of controlling factor will want to bring about changes in accordance with what they (and whoever else has assisted them in this monetary augmentation) want. Then you have the ongoing condition of our country soon to follow.\n\nIf you see, the situation went from what is good for the people, to what is good for the persons... \n\nThis, I believe, may have been the thinking behind the development of religious supremacy. If we all believe in one thing and are for one cause, then it is much more likely that we will succeed and progress. If we are all fighting as individuals with unwaivering and unforgiving beliefs, then we will hardly find any success that brings about a true progression. \n\nWhat is most frightening to me, is that it isn't the single belief in a single God or entity that is the key (it may be on a personal level, but is presently impossible at this time in the world on a global scale), it is the simple belief in the human condition and the acceptance and love of all of our earthling inhabitants that will bring about this free society.\n\nThings that are loved and cared for are hardly mistreated. If nothing is mistreated, nothing is offended, and nothing is erased. This is a very simple concept. \n\nIn the end, this sort of ideology does not request conformity, it incites appreciation of all and is ultimately our true road to freedom. \n\nHope that helps...

9	What is Sweden really like? So often i hear Britain being compared to Sweden from a political point of view.  Usually by people with political inclinations.  So on what grounds is Britain like Sweden?  Does Sweden have something similar to the NHS?  Does Sweden have a minimuum wage economy where people that work 40 hours a week find it dificult to make ends meet?  And i always thought that the family unit and family values were very high on the Swedish agenda, unlike in Britain where family values have disappeared down the drain over the last 10 years or so.  At what age do Swedish children start school?  At what age do they leave school?  What is the schooling system like?  Do swedish youngsters start their working life with debts they will probably not clear till they reach middle age.\n\nOnly thing i know of Sweden is that booze is very heavily taxed and that they have light treatment to tackle SAD.  So anyone that can tell me why Sweden is compared to Britain as a society would be appreciated :-) Kids start school at 6, and have cheap/virtually free childcare before that, if required.  Also after school care, in school, with qualified teachers.  They finish lower secondary at 15(ish) after 9th grade, and most continue to upper secondary (gymnasium) for 3 more years.  All schools are free, including tertiary education.  Healthcare is virtually free (you pay a small fee per GP visit.) and yes, nationalised. Dental care is free until you are 18.  \n\nAs for family values, well, we love our kids.  I fear you would be disappointed with swedish attitudes to marriage etc, however, most people here simply don't bother getting married, and are perfectly happy that way (I recall one wee girl at preschool being surprised to find out you _could_ get married before you have children). That doesn't mean families aren't important, they are, very much so, but I rather the Swedish idea of what a family is tends not to revolve around a religious (or even civil) ceremony.\n\nYes there are people who work 40 hour weeks and have trouble making ends meet, but that's true anywhere.  Not everyone is in a position to get a good paying job, either through lack of skill, or unwillingness to move.  Most people are doing "ok", and real poverty is pretty uncommon.\n\nFrom a New Zealander's perspective, Sweden is like NZ in another language.  It's really not much like Britain, culturally or politically (and yes, I have lived in the UK too). \n\nAnd the light treatment stuff is probably overdone in the foreign press.  As are the alcohol taxes :)  Also, the pop music is better here.
3	how many population of Tokyo? The 23 special wards that make up what is considered Tokyo proper have a population (1997) of 7,830,323 . Tokyo Metropolis extends to the west of the central city and has a population of 11,680,490 (1999). Most of the difference in population is concentrated in the Tama district, which is on the western border of Tokyo. The western reaches of the Tama district and the islands are lightly populated. The population of Tokyo Metropolis peaked in 1987 at about 11,917,000. There has been a decline since then, particularly in the central wards where high land costs and expansion of commercial centers have reduced residential land. Suburban areas in the Tama district and in neighboring prefectures (Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saltarea) have grown rapidly. The Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area, defined as Tokyo Metropolis plus the urbanized portions of three adjacent prefectures, now totals more than 27 million inhabitants; it is the largest urban area in the world. Crowding is a serious problem, particularly in the 23 wards and close suburbs. In Tokyo Metropolis the population density is 5443 persons per sq km (14,097 per sq mi), while in the 23 wards the density is 13,000 persons per sq km (33,670 per sq mi). By contrast, the average density for Japan as whole, itself a crowded country in comparison to other countries, is 328 persons per sq km (850 per sq mi). Problems that relate to crowding include traffic congestion, high land prices and rents, air and noise pollution, lack of open space and greenery, and blocked access to direct sunlight in areas of high-rise construction.
4	How do I shut down cpu for transportation to another state so that I do not damage the internal parts? It used to be with old hard drives you had to park the heads before you moved the computer.  With the newest models of hard drives, they automatically park every time power is disconnected.  So now you just have to make sure all the cables are disconnected, and everything is packed securely without a lot of rattling.

1	Why is the nature of science? ......That we replace old beliefs with new beliefs based on incoming evidence and facts? science is the mechanism which we use to purify generalizations.   the action of science is exactly the replacement of old beliefs with new ones based on incoming evidence, and human determination, and decision, about what is "fact".\n but this is only the hard machinery of science, the method, the facilitation of the nature, and the vehicle of the essence of science. i am no prophet, and do not intend to subjectively interpret the universe in the manner of pronouncing some concrete, end-all, answer, so in the spirit of science, let us consider science, make some observations, and stab at some generalizations.\n    while observing science, we humans have come to one of the most startlingly obvious, and startlingly powerful, realizations; that of the principle of natural selection. this principle classically refers to biological evolution, and the ever-present consequences which acts on living things and environments when they interact.\nthe principle more recently has embodied a somewhat more anthropocentric form. richad dawkins [1] was one of the early and explicit proponents of visualizing the effort of natural selection as the "selfishness" of genes, and that the driving force of the principle was the expressed selfishness of genes trying to do nothing but replicate themselves, and propagate into the future. the longer that they survive, the more likely it is that they will replicate.  this embodies the cut throat behaviors in nature, as well as the collectivity and cooperativity. this is all very well, and nice, and has been very well recieved in the world of biology  (but not because we are biochauvinists, overly able to relate to something once it is reminicent of human face, but because, the muse of science it the same as the muse of poetry, and imagery enhances scince on a grand scale, so that a better analogies will lead to easier, and better visualization, which will lead to easier and better work). this notion is just precursor to what this question has lead us to. in his book, richard dawkins goes further to introduce the notion of "memes" (mee' ms), which are intended to be the analogue of genes, only in the mental realm. they are ideas, tricks, songs, poems, sloagans... truly, anything which can be abstracted, realized, and passed from one mind to another. so that the idea of memes is a meme itself, and it replicated itself from the mind of an author, to my mind, via language, and if  you have not heard of this already, then it has replicated itself again into your mind. very much like genes, memes continue to exist only through replication, and they may mutate as they pass through different minds. yet, unlike genes, a meme can be very sucessful in replication, and yet be very destructive to its host. take for instance, heroin use. it is a learned trick, which has some concrete subjective effect, and yet ultimately has a negative effect on the life of the host, the replication of their genes. for the most part, memes have no regard for genes. this is dangerous for a society which is driven by memes.\n science seems to be the principle of natural selection, but not gene selection in the way of darwin, but a sifting sort of meme selection, acting on a very small class of memes, serving to develop them into the most powerful and planet altering memes that humans have ever seen. because of the power of these things, the careful selection of the memes of scientific principles is very important. the memes which are selected by science are the human interpretations of the principle(s) of the universe. certainly, natural selection existed before it generated the human mind. it was simply left to science to put it into worded interpretation. this did not take very long. not only that, but more than one person came upon the idea, independent of each other. how universal is the action of science then? \n   in a sense, science is a special case of the principle of natural selection, if you g
1	If I throw a radio into a tub of water, how long before it is safe to pull the radio out? If it is a battery powered radio you should be able to pull it out without getting shocked (unless it's using some pretty powerful batteries).  If it plugs in to the wall unplug it, wait a couple of minutes to be safe, and pull it out.  But I think the real question is: why would you throw a radio into a tub of water?!
2	Any advice for a Nursing Student? I'm getting nervous about the Nursing Program I will be entering in. I know it's going to be a lot of work but is there any advice? I already have 2 BA degrees in Psychology and Communication, so I know how college is but it seems Nursing is much more harder. I guess, I'm just trying to build up my self confidence in doing this. Any suggestions? As long as you don´t forget you are dealing with humans you should be alright! You´ll need your psychology and communication skills since those are a very important part of nursing :-D\nYou´ll have to do stuff that you might think are disgusting but just try to imagine how you would feel in the position of the patient you are helping and then try to be the person you´d want doing this to you/with you etc. \nYou´ll be responsible for other people´s health, life, well being - be aware of this, always live up to your own standards and don´t abuse the power you are given!\nAll in all, if you try to be great, you will be and hopefully you´ll love your job and don´t let hard shifts get you down!
9	Saddam Hussein vs. G.W.Bush ? It makes me wonder. I'am not have sympathie for Hussein,\nbut how could it be that he will be killed, beacause he kills people\non his own country and G.W.Bush become as a hero so he\nkilled so many people without a reason in a foreign land, the\nIrak. Is that a fair world ?\n\nLet me ask again, Bush starts a war with lies about weapons\nin the irak. He kills there thousands of  people.\nWhen it were not the president of the USA, per example\npresident of tacka tucka land, he would be guilty in a\ninternational tribunal, like Hussein. Wrong world ! It is not Bush that sentence Saddam to death. It is Iraqi people like you.

2	Is the PSA test a good gage of cancer? If a rectal exam was normal, your doctor may repeat the PSA test to see if it remains high. Results from this test do not confirm a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Other conditions can raise a PSA level including an enlarged prostate, an infected or inflamed prostate, or prostate biopsy or surgery. Further testing may include a transrectal ultrasound. A tissue biopsy is needed to make the diagnosis of prostate cancer.
5	Will the USA ever create a great soccer player like a Maradona or a Pele? And would that make them win a WC? I believe there is a chance that we will eventually, however I would not say that it would make us win the world cup, cause teams create great players all the time and doens't mean they are gonna win the World Cup, look at Spain and England, and even Argentina hasn't won in awhile.  To win it takes a good mix of luck and talent.  Right now the closest thing we have to a possible Pele, or Maradona is Freddy Adu, and while I think he is a great player, I don't believe he will be as good as them, but he is developing nicely, he is only 15 or 16 I am not sure.

I would recommend you buy hosting - its not expensive, and provides much better features than free hosts.
8	Should I be angry with my husband? We have been married for almost 2 years and together almost 4.  I grew up an only child and very independent. My husband claims to be independent but his mother is very controling and ALWAYS did things for both the boys, especially him since he was the youngest of the two.  So his independence is nothing like mine. I love him dearly but he constantly involves his mother in our financial status and asks her for help when we need it. I understand that being young and married (and in school) can be hard but I just want both of us to have control over our lives. When she gets involved, all control goes to her and my husband and I fight about that.  He thinks that there is nothing wrong with it but I feel like I am just his roomate who happens to share a bank account. I hate getting mad at him but not talking to me about and involving his mother does not help. I am all about communication. We are both 23 and I feel that we should be dependent only on each other. Am I wrong for being upse No you are not wrong to be upset!  Those are your feelings!
2	longes penis known? longest penis known in history The largest erect member in medical literature would be the 14-inch organ mentioned by Dr. David Reuben in his book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (1969). Reuben didn’t divulge any source for this figure, and there was no independent verification, so you may question his accuracy. The largest medically verified penis on record is 13.5 inches long and 6.25 inches around, documented in the early twentieth century by Dr. Robert L. Dickinson. Other sources (Alfred Kinsey, Masters and Johnson, etc.) mention specimens ranging from 9.5 to 12 inches.\n\nThen there are the dubious claims of immense penis size by various personages operating within the sex industry (read: porn actors). These claims are almost invariably false, the result of exaggeration and hype by unscrupulous dealers hoping to hawk more products. Take the legendary Long Dong Silver, for instance. Made famous by the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, his one enduring trait was his supposedly 18-inch penis. Totally fraudulent, as it turns out; in fact, there are videos in which he appears only normal sized.

4	Internet, computer, possible ventrilo problems, I don't know? Since yesterday, I've been randomly getting kicked off WOW, when I play. I believe it's due to ventrilo, but no one I know, seems to know how to fix it. When I get kicked off, not only do I get kicked off WOW, but I lose all connectivity with the internet as well. I have to then restart my computer and everything is back up again. Why is this doing this. I've check for upgrades, and redownloaded ventrilo, nothing seems to work? Could someone please clue me in with what's going on? Are you on dialup?\n\nIf you are on dialup, you cannot connect to any Ventrilo server unless it is set to ultra low quality. MOST servers are not set to low quality.\n\nYou will lose connection to Vent, Wow maybe even entire internet if Vent is trying to use more bandwith than you currently have on your connection.\n\nDoes this help?\n\nAlso as the source below suggests, you may be behind some sort of Firewall or router preventing packets or data flow.\n\nLastly (and in very rare cases) your internet provider may have certain ports or routing tables blocked to prevent specific internet activities from happening. I know a friend who was unable to play Battlefield 2 or WoW because her ISP had ports blocked preventing game play.\n\nTo check for lost packets run a trace route. This will test to see if you are losing data due to either your ISP or the game itself.\n\nIn Windows XP \n\n1. Go to Start\n2. Go to Run\n3. Type "cmd" (no quotes)\n4. Type "tracert <server name>"\n\ni.e. If the IP of the WOW server is 23.121.33.118, you will type \n"tracert 23.121.33.118"\n\nTo get the IP information of the WoW server you play on, please consult World Of Warcraft Official Website or contact a staff member of WoW. I neither play wow, nor have any information on its server details.\n\nThis should get the ball rolling. Does it help? let me know

And of course, because she gets to use magic and go on adventures! Going to Hogwarts would be so cool. I just think that she would be such a great person to be. Good question, by the way!

1	125 g metal blocat temperature 93.2 C was imersed in 100G of water at 18.3C? if the specific heat of metal= 0.900 J/gC, find the final temperature of the water and the block! You solve these sort questions by calculating the energy contained in the sample (blocat?) and the water initially, and realizing the final energy content must be the same, or less if the system has lost energy to the environment.\n\nIf you actually run this experiement in a lab, you will find that the final temperature is the same as the air temperature of the lab.  If it would be warmer, you did not wait long enough, the system would lose energy to its environment.  The 2nd Law of Thermo prevents the reverse from occurring.  This is probably not the expected answer, but I believe it is correct.

Ive also been to Panama, Kuwait, Iraq and have experience as a heavy equipment operator because of the miliary. Not to mention the benifits of being a veteran like retirement and a VA home loan. \n\n...thats my sales pitch. if you want to know more then yahoo messenger me at sean_mchugh6 or just post your comments on joining the military to pay for college. As an Air Force retiree with 21 years of service time, I applaud you for considering this approach. Nowhere on earth can you get a better deal.  Obviously there are constraints especially in time of War, but  not only will most Universities give credit  for Military service, the military will reward you by providing assistance in the form of tuition and grants to allow you to complete your  courses. In addition, University of Phoenix will assist you with online courses that can be carried with you regardless of location. In addition, military service provides the maturity to stay  the course.  I would consider the U.S Air Force as a first choice, and the Navy a close second.
2	Why do guys smell so weird in the morning after they wake up? I've had a few boyfriends and whenever I'd spend the night and wake up the next day, they smelled really weird.  I have noticed most guys smell funny when they get up in the morning.  Granted, most people probably don't smell awesome, but guys' scents seem to be stronger and similar.  What is this?  Testosterone?  Oil? I say the same thing. I really think that it's the hair under there arms or what type of deodorant they where. I think mens deodorant don't have enough of fragrance to hold they odor or they PH balance. Boys seem to sweat alot when they sleep too. So maybe this is a reason why.

8	R women really psychotic? Or do i just seem to be attracting Melodramatic pantomime queens? Picking up women is very easy for me. I can't even walk down the street without some girl trying to give/get numbers. Unfortunately 9 times out of 10 we have nothing in common and i can't seem to let go of them without them trying to kill me ,themselves,blackmail,self-mutilation,depression,or becoming my next stalkers. What should i do? I don't them to hurt themselves but i don't want to be stuck with them either\nwhat whould i do? Don't settle for just anybody that you meet walking down the street.  Generally men and women are on different wave lengths.  Lots of women are generally melodramatic and some are gold diggers.  Your best bet is to get to know some one for a long period of time but don't attach yourself to just one person, but always be open and honest.  One day you will meet that special one and you will be happy.  Good luck!!

Read the bottle and do not give honey too infants under one year, they do not have mature immune systems to the botulism that may be present.\n\nMy wife swears that a 50/50 mix of honey with ACV (apple cider vinegar) helps prevent her leg cramps and has other beneficial effects.  Heat the ACV first and it will mix much easier with the honey perhaps in a half empty plastic honey bottle (leave air space until mixed).  Then take perhaps three teaspoons per day with apple cider (or any fruit juice).\n\nSugur and honey probably sweeten equally, but honey may have a plus.
2	I mastubate too much , may be 5 times a day , does this affect my penis size coz its small .....? No is doesn't  instead it may help you increase... hehe\n\nremember what small really is....\n\n\nThis is in my own writing, it wasn't copy and pasted, enjoy it, it took me a while to write it and hope is beneficial to everyone. Thanks.\n\nSince I have answer to many of these question regarding penis sizes, i recollected most of my answers, read it and you make be satisfy with a correct answer.\nIs a little less than average, but i could predict that at least 20% of males are of that size or under ;) , well actually height does not matter, some people over six feet tall dont have a 5 inch dick! I came up with this after researching it! \npenis sizes!\nless than 4 inches is way below ! >4.5-5.0 moderate > 5.0- 6.3 (average 65% of any male u encounter are around this size!) > 6.7 (10-20% of popul) more than average > 7.2-9 less than 10% (gifted) > 9+ thats a big ******* story! ahhaah 0.1% of the male population *(Different web site and researches show these stat as the average penis 5.1, 5.7, 5.9, 5.877 from these numbers you can conclude what’s average, since all those are say to be average, I guess they are diff because are taken in different regions, let say if u take the same test in china you would find out that 4.7 is average! and 6 is to big. well other internet survey say to be 6.2 so is funny because it does not match with true measurement, so self measurements adds more than 2 cm. Be proud of what you have, the average vagina is about 3-4 inches so there is no problem filling up that space! and if the woman loves you, there is no problem.. but everyone wants a bigger penis even I and i have 7.3 :) .... **** dont they say smaller pennis stand up longer? enjoy \nyou don’t worry; I bet money that 80% + those that make fun of other with small organs have less than 6.6 inches! cuz only 10% of the population have over 7 inches!\ndo stretching it may give u a few cm\n<proud! \nwill know ur final size when u reach 17... you will gain from .2-1.5 inches from that age up to 17! \n\n\nBUT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN KNOWING THE IDEAL AND DREAM SIZE, Here goes **\n\nThe ideal penis would be above average size (if you were given a woman what would you pick the same girl with smaller or bigger breast? yes is possible you pick above average and not to big either, is the same thing for penis..) what would that size be? hmm I would definitely say 7-8 inches x 6 inches of circumference..thats a bit bigger than porn actor though, most porn actors have between 6-7 inches but since their are bellow 6 feet their penis look bigger on them... and so there are porn actor with more than 8 inches...(note that those male actors on the internet with mega penis are mostly the same people...there aren’t many with over 10 inches...) like I said is preference some woman may prefer something smaller then 5 inches... or something bigger than 7 ... but at the end you will love a woman with small tities you usually never dump her for that.... it happens to be the same with women and our penis... Hope this helps..\n\nforget the motion of the ocean.... sorry girls but a 4 inch guy can do what a 7 inch penis do ( if they know what they are doing of course)vaginas are 2-2.5 inches wide therefore a penis with girth of 6 inches will reach and stretch you so all ur nerves are receiving pressure, so is ur G spot everything is done by PRESSURE, NOT THE MOTION OF THE OCEAN learn that....a 5 inch penis can almost do the same thing but give the same person different sizes and u will see the different of course anything over 9 inches can hurt and less pleasure but anything from 7-8.5 inches is the BEST of sizes of course if it has 6-6.5 inches of girth\n\n\nI had like 6.5 when I was 16 and now I am 18 it is 7.3,.. Don’t feel bad, try doing exercises like stretching! maybe u gain something in 1 month! keep going if u see any gain maybe instead of gaining 1 inch.. u gain 2-3! \npenis sizes!\nless than 4 inches is way below ! >5.2 modera

0	Is the end of the world coming? I would like some answers from people of different religions.I heard we're in the last era of the world... I'm not afraid, \nI just wanna know what you think about it or what you've heard. Now notice carefully the end shown in: \n\nDaniyl 12:4-7—\n4 But you, O Daniyl, shut up the words, and seal the book to the time of the end; many will run to and fro, and knowledge will be increased.\n5 Then I, Daniyl, looked; and behold, there stood two others, one on this side of the bank of the river; and the other on that side of the bank of the river.\n6 And one said to the man clothed in linen, who on that future day is teaching: How long will it be to the end of these wonders?\n7 Then I heard the man clothed in linen, who on that future day is teaching, when he held up his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and vowed by Him Who lives forever, that: It will be for a time, times, and a half, when Yahweh will have accomplished pouring out His power through His holy people, all these things will be finished. \n\n\nYahweh again shows us the end, in a time—three and one-half years, that is filled with destruction. The first time (3½ years) was the first half of the seven year peace plan that was stopped in its midst (Daniyl 9:27). Then Yahweh shows us times in Daniyl 12:7. One time is 3½ years; times is 3½ years plus 3½ years, which equals 7 years. \n\nThe seven year peace plan started October 13, 1993, shut down April 13, 1997 after three and one-half years of action. The seven year peace plan stayed shut down for a duration of two times, that's seven years and was signed back into action on April 13, 2004 on the very day prophesied. \n\nPresident Bush and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon restarted the seven year plan on the very day Yahweh showed it would go back into action. \n\n\n------------------------------...\n\n\nWe Are Now In The Last Three and One-half Years (Time) Of Man's Governments Of And By The People \n\nDaniyl says it will be the greatest time of trouble ever. \n\nDaniyl 12:1—\nAnd at that time will Micahyah stand up, the great ruler who stands for the children of Your people; and there will be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation to that time. And at that time your people will be delivered, everyone who will be found written in the Book of life.\nThe Savior says the same. \n\nMattithyah 24:21-22—\n21 For then will be great tribulation, such as has not come to pass since the beginning of the world to this time—no, nor ever will be.\n22 And unless those days were shortened, there would no flesh be saved; but for the elect's sake, those days will be shortened. \n\nIn this same time period there is extreme hatred among the nations. For proof of this, all you have to do is watch the world news. \n\nMattithyah 24:7—\nFor nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, and pestilences; disease epidemics, and earthquakes in place after place. \n\nThen comes the nuclear wars that will darken the sun. \n\nMattithyah 24:29—\nImmediately, but after the tribulation of those days will the sun be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. \n\nNow learn a parable so you will know when this time is at hand. \n\nMattithyah 24:32-33—\n32 Now learn a parable from the fig tree: When its branch becomes tender and puts out leaves, you know that summer is near.\n33 In the same way, when you see all these things, know that His coming and the end of the age is near, at the very door. \n\nPlease notice, these are things we can see taking place. Compare this with the following. The Apostle Shaul spoke of the same time in: \n\nI Thessalonians 4:16-17—\n16 For Yahshua Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the malak gadol, and with the trumpet of Yahweh. And the dead in Messiah will be raised first,\n17 Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet Yahshua in the air; and so will we ever be with Yahshua. \n\nThese two verses and the following go together in the same time perio

9	what is oligarchy? Technically it means rule by the few. \n\nRule by the wealthy has a separate name, plutocracy. \n\nIn an oligarchy the ruling elite are called oligarchs; in a plutocracy the ruling elite are called plutocrats.\n\nEarly modern Venice was more of an oligarchy than a plutocracy. \n\nSome would say the modern-day United States is more of a plutocracy. (Almost all Senators and Presidents have had net worths well over $1,000,000) Becoming an elected representative at the national level does require a relatively large fortune, even with campaign donations.

1	What is the square root of the square root of -16 in imaginary numbers? -16 as in negative 16... Palindrome Geoff is right about how to arrive at the root he described, however, that is not the whole story.\n\nJust as there are TWO numbers that satisfy the meaning of √16 (that is, 4 and -4) there are actually FOUR numbers that satisfy the meaning of √(√(-16)):\n● √2 + i√2\n● -√2 + i√2\n● √2 - i√2\n● -√2 - i√2\n\nGeoff's analysis about "turning the angle halfway" toward the positive x axis is a good intuitive way of understanding what is going on. However, what he left out is that it DOESN'T MATTER which direction you turn, clockwise or counter-clockwise. Both directions are equally valid and both should be taken into account.\n\nFor √(-16), turning clockwise gives you 4i, counter-clockwise gives you -4i\n\nFor √(4i), turning clockwise gives you √2 + i√2, counter-clockwise gives you -√2 - i√2 (remember, you are going halfway to the positive x axis the long way)\n\nFor √(-4i), turning clockwise gives you -√2 + i√2, counter-clockwise gives you √2 - i√2
1	Why is the sky dark at night? This is a classic question that puzzled people for centuries, known as Obler's Paradox. If there are so many stars in the sky, why is the night sky not lit up from all the stars? \n\nThere are several interesting aspects to this question: \n\n1. First, distant stars are receding from us at increasing speeds (Hubble's Law). The speed of these distant stars causes their light to be Doppler-shifted out of the visible range, so our eyes cannot see the light from these stars any more.\n\n2. The universe is full of dark matter, which does not shine, and probably absorbs light, so a lot of light gets absorbed this way. \n\n3. If a distant star is receding at close to the speed of light, its light might not ever reach us, or might take a very long time to reach us, so the light has not got here yet from some stars. \n\n4. There are black holes in the universe, that are objects so dense that photons are drawn in by the immense gravitational forces, and cannot escape. These also reduce the amount of light that we can receive. \n\n5. There are vast empty areas of space, so there are not an infinite number of stars available to produce light to brighten our nighttime sky. \n\nThere are probably some other considerations as well, but this at least gives you a starting point when considering this very interesting question.

X1, X2 and X3 are all independent of each other. Describe the distribution of X1+ X2 + X3. What is p(X>0)? \n\n(statistics questions) Is 3 the standard deviation or the variance?  Since X1, X2, and X3 are all nromal and independent, then \n\nX1 + X2 + X3 ~ N(0+0+0 = 0, sqrt(3^2+3^2+3^2) = sqrt(27)), if 3 was the SD.\nN(0, 3+3+3 = 9) if 3 was the variance.\n\nIn general, if X_i ~ N(mu_i, sigma_i), where sigma_i is the SD, then the sum of X_i ~ N(sum mu_i, sqrt(sum (sigma_i)^2)).\n\nSince the mean of your distribution is 0, then P(X1+X2+X3>0) = 0.5.

2	pulled muscle? my mum has just pulled a muscle washing her hair, its down her left side, she is in pain and it's taking her breath away? what could this be? should she see a doctor? If it's confirmed that this is a pulled muscle, go out quickly and buy a tube of arnica gel, preferably A.Vogel or Roberts. These are the ones available at health shops and better chemists. I don't find the Weleda so effective. \n\nAs you rub it in to the pulled muscle the skin feels very cold and within five minutes there is quite a dramatic reduction of pain. Keep massaging it in a few times a day and the pain will go quicker than if arnica not used. Arnica gel is used by physios on sports injuries to muscles.

1	simplest proof of sir fermats last theorem? please refer to the url www.in.answers.yahoo.com/\nquestion/?qid=20060608054\n655AAW70ig The question now is not if we understand your proof. The question is, do u understand what u r doing actually?\n\nI didn't see your proof of N=a^2-b^2 for any number, but I take it as u have done it correctly becos this is true and is, in fact, very obvious. N=a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)=c.d Any number can be expressed as product of other numbers, this is trivial. Even the nondivisible prime number can be expressed in such way by choosing a and b such that either a+b or a-b is 1.\n\nAs for your proof..\n\na^n = b^n + c^n\n\nu r trying to show ALL numbers can ONLY be written in a^n - b^n when n=2, and not n>2. Since c^n is included in ALL number, hence, there is no a^n = b^n + c^n for n>2.\n\nU started out by stating n=2. a^2-b^2. You then factor this to become (a+b)(a-b), then u restate a and b in term of x, e and d.... a=x+e, b=x+d. you then substitute a and b with x+e and x+d. Then, u found for the product to be equal N, given one side is a+b, the other side must be a-b.... and hence u get back a^2-b^2. Then u conclude, n must be 2 and nothing else.\n\nThe problem is.... u r essentially doing nothing here except, stating a^2-b^2... write in in another form(factor form).... write a and b in another form(x,e,d).... then u do everything in reverse again by turning (x,e,d) back into a and b.... turn factor form into a^2-b^2 form again. see. u r not doing anything at all except taking a u-turn and come back again.\n\nwhen a-b=d, now matter how fancifully u express a and b, their difference is still d.\n\nSo, u dont have to repeat your proof here again and again.
3	do you think it's sad that people here are worried more about getting 2 points then gaining knowledge? I started to fall for it, almost brain washing I think about 1/3 of the people come one here for a legitimate reason....to gain knowledge about something they know thing about, need help in, etc.  I found this site by accident, trying to help my daughter find an answer regarding algebra (not my subject, just ask the teachers I had in high school).  Read all the info about how to get points so you can ask more questions if you so desire so I figured I would answer questions, etc. just in case she needed more help with something I can't answer.\n\nI saw some really stupid questions, and I had to laugh when I saw a lot of people giving dumb answers or just the typical "thanks for the 2 points" answers.  I don't even bother with them.  Yeah, I could get 2 easy points but like I said I don't bother with it.  It's kind of pointless.\n\nThis thing can be addicting as far as answer questions (good or stupid) and really wanting to help someone.

2	how can a girl have a orgasm during intercourse?i will be 30 in 1 1/2 months and never have!? Try stimulating yourself during intercourse. You will get yours and your man will be incredibly turned on from watching you. The best position for this is you lying on your back and him between your legs, kind of like missionary, but on his knees. If you aren't comfortable with him watching at first, do it doggy style and just reach back there (this is also a great way to stroke his scrotum, just the touch will drive him crazy.) Some women just can't orgasm without clitoral stimulation and there is nothing wrong with doing WHATEVER it takes to get yours!!

An elliptical orbit is an oval orbit, to say it in shorter words, and instead of having one center it has two, called foci, it revolves around those two points to create the orbit that it travels in.

Before that he was already an evolutionist (closer to Lamark) but he figured out natural selection only after comparing varieties of the same species on nearby islands and finding out some islands had species that where absent in others close by. Until then he had worked mostly with domestic animals and breeders. Reading Malthus' essay on population also helped.\nThe second I would say was finding out that someone else (I don't recall the name just now) was working in the same line as he was, that is, on the idea of natural selection. Only then did he sit down and write On the Origin of Species, long after his return from sea.

5	Do you think Dwayne Roloson will re-sign with Edmonton? I know Minnesota shipped him north because his contract expires after this season.  All the expert banter I heard after that was that there was no way he wanted to stay with the Oilers.  But after all his playoff success, do you think he might stay? Until the injury, I would say no way.  Roloson had made himself more money during the playoffs then any player.  He was going to sign a fat contract, that probably a small market team like Edmonton would not pay.  \n\nNow with the injury, I think there is a chance.  Specifically with the salary cap, Edmonton should be able to give him a competitive offer.  This is especially true now that his value has gone down with the injury.  \n\nThe question is, do they want him?  He is 34 with a serious knee injury.  It is not certain he will return to the same playing form of the playoffs.

5	What is the best way to do long distance runs(3km-5km,  crosscountry). give me some strategy, tactics etc? eg. Some websites where they have rthe elavant information. You can check out www.runnersworld.com for other info, they have advice from some current and former running stars that might help. I'm not sure if you're asking about racing or completing the 3-5k. If you want to complete the 3-5k then I'd suggest start slow and gradually increase your pace over the duration. \nIf you're trying to race it then ...I ran crosscountry and track in college in the US and my tactic for the longer races (3km,5km and CC) was to hang with the leaders of the race as long as I could. Over time, and with specific training, I was able to keep up with the leaders and be competitive. My opinion is that trying to hang back in the early going and sprinting at the end was a bad tactic, because I was so far back I was never going to catch the leaders. Go out fast with the leaders..if you sense the pace is going too fast for you then begin to settle into the pace you can handle (but remember, the winner is the person who can handle the pain for the longest, so your handling pace should still have you in some mild discomfort). Always look ahead and see if you can pick off the runner ahead of you. Some of this depends on your goals - do you want to win, do you want a fast time, are you training enough etc. Anyway, hope this helped.

Hes called my cousin to telling him he's been trying to call me cause he needs to talk to me.I havent texted or called him back. I dont understand him, he's broken my heart so many times and i kept taking him back and now im trying to move on and here he comes again trying to contact me. Im tired of the changing your mind thing he does where he wants to be with me and hes sure and then the next he doesnt want to be with me anymore Ive been dating and now he pops up with this. Why does he continue to do this to me why cant he just have stayed with me or moved on and left me alone? What's going on with him is guys are WEIRD!lol He isn't sure he wants you but he is sure he doesn't want anyone else to have you. The male ego is a very strange thing. Most guys think once they break up with you that you should never date again. My advice is to tell him you are through playing games. Tell him he had his chance again and again and again it sounds like and he didnt' want to commit. By confusing you he is hoping to keep you alone and available JUST IN CASE he finally grows up. Better to cut you losses now and if you two are meant to be you will find each other again. Time tends to heal all wounds but you obviously haven't had enough time yet. Be nice about it but be clear with him that it is over! GOOD LUCK!

6	Online banking question? My bank is Chase. My stepmom has access to my online banking; it is part of her account. If I deposit a check into the account, using online banking can she see who wrote the check? I was just wondering how it would show up. Thank you It depends. Some banks, instead of sending back your checks with every statement, send only copies of the checks, and this may include all checks deposited to the account.  If you go online and look at the statement, you can click on any line item on the statement and it will bring up an image of that item, front and back.  If Chase does that then yes, by going into the online statement and clicking on any item she will be able to see an image of that item.\n\nIf the deposit item in question is a check drawn on a local bank, you may be able to go to that bank and cash it, then take the cash and make a cash deposit into your joint checking account.  This way all your mom can see is a cash deposit.  if you don't even want her to see the cash, and need to pay some bills, take the cash and go to the post office and buy money orders for the amounts of the bills you need to pay, and send the money orders as payments.  This way, your mom will not see any deposit at all, or at most a very much reduced one.\n\nI used to do all this to keep it looking like I had no income and no deposits to my checking account.  Once I went to the post office and bought a total of $5,000 in a whole bunch of money orders, and only $300 or so actually made it as cash into my checking account.  For all intents and purposes if you looked at my checking account it looked like I was dead broke and in abject poverty.

6	What are the types of cover letter and tell me about them some words.? Targeted cover letter\nThis type of letter has immense potential for getting the interview since it is normally sent for an advertised position. You are able to highlight your skills and experience that match the job requirements and motivate why you are the perfect person for the job. It is also called a response letter. \n\nRecommendation cover letter \nThis type of letter produces the best results since you and the company already has something in common. You share an acquaintance. It is used when you have been referred to the enterprise by someone reputable. Make sure that you mention the person's name within the first paragraph of your letter. It is also called the network letter. Always try to get a referrer because it enhances the possibility of getting the job. \n\nReport back cover letter It is also called a follow-up on a previous letter or interview. It may seem desperate but if your wording is correct, it can show determination and attention to detail. It works the same as following up on a sales lead and brings your application to the attention of the recruiter. Use this letter three or more days after an interview to show your interest, highlight skills, and to thank the recruiter for the interview. Try to mention skills and experience that you may have missed during an interview. Do not repeat the information from your first cover letter. It must be fresh and original. \n\nMany recruiters feel that job seekers send cover letters to a broad audience. They are looking for targeted and original letters. The person who receives the letter must think that you are writing specifically for him. It must motivate the recruiter to call you for an interview or job offer. \n\nmore on http://www.cvtips.com/cover_letter_types.html

2	My husbands left eye always looks red but not the right eye. What causes this? Does your husband suffer with allergies?  It could be a reaction to something he came in contact with.  Does he rub the eye a good bit?  It may be caused by something he was working with and by rubbing his eye he may have accidentally rubbed something in it.  Does his eye burn or water at all?  If his eye problem does not go away in the next day, tell him he should see a eye doctor.  It could be more serious than allergies.  Eye sight is a precious gift we all have.  If the problem persists, he should get it looked at and taken care of ASAP.  Good luck!

4	how to log in yahoo messenger with two ids simultaneously? Use two different browsers at the same time such as Mozilla and IE. Log into a different one on each browser, so ID#1 on Mozilla and ID#2 on IE.\n\nIt's based on cookies, not IP address, and the two browsers don't share cookies. It won't work in different windows of the same browser, as far as I know.
5	Do Kobe and LeBron compare to Michael? There have been so many debates on who will be or is the next Michael Jordan. If you asked me that mold has been broken! There was only one and there will never be another. Give it up, it's done! MJ was the best player to play the game and we should all be grateful that we were able to witness it. Kobe, on your best day you are no Michael Jordan! Slap in the face to Michael. Lebron is to young to determine and Kobe is to one dimensional, and not to mention people hate Kobe, Michael was loved by all. Michael is hands down the greatest ever he changed the game as we know it. Kobe is a selfish basketball player, and will never be the clutch player jordan ever was.

Would you prefer your boyfriend to have very short, medium gel-able, behind ears, or long hair\n\nor a certain style that you love to see. ie the beckam mohawk\n\nI have long hair and used to like it, but not sure anymore, I don't think any girl is going to let her relationship with you depend on the length of your hair.  Wear it how you like, but too long it starts looking like a mop.
1	Can we see sun light out of the earth atmosphere same way we do on earth or is it all dark out there  and why? Since sun from the Earth appears in a blue sky in space it is in a black background. Blue sky is the result of reflection of sunlight from very small drops of water in the atmosphere. The angle of radiation causes blue color. But sometimes when the angle changes, the color changes too. For example in dusk we have a red sky. Because of that in space there is no atmosphere (include water drops) there is no reflection and it causes a black sky. But about the brightness of sun we can say its radiation is much more dangerous than when we are on Earth. Because there is no filtering system (For example Ozone layer) and all spectrums and UVR can reach you and hurt you.
4	TRYING TO SETUP OUTLOUK e-mail where do i find the information lie POP3 SMT SERVER?

Some providers also make it easy and have both servers as a generic "mail.<service provider>.com".  But if you're not into trial and error, just contact them.

8	Why? do marry man cheat on there wife for some young female.? I think its usually because of sex.  Most times when you look at cheating situations its because the man doesn't feel he gets enough sex at home.  The fact it generally happens with younger women is because younger females are more apt to be looking for sex than older ones and younger women tend to look toward older men.

2	What's the difference between a blender and a juicer? I have started getting interested in juicing in order to increase my intake of fruit and veg and hence improve my nutrition.

Thanks. blender just blends...everything u put in a blender just mix up forming a batter....whereas juicer takes away pulp n almost all fibres...gives only juice.
6	How do I find work at home and do not invest money to assemble products or so? That can be a tricky one. There are plenty of "get rich quick" schemes online and they all prey on one thing... people's greediness to make money as quickly and easily as possible. First let me discuss what to avoid...\n\n1) Chain letters. You've probably seen it... it starts with something disguised as news or a testimonial. Then you get on to the pitch, which is, here is a list of people and you have to send $5 cash to each of them, requesting a "report". Then you drop off the bottom person and put your name on the top and start spamming everyone on the internet hoping to get more gullible people to sign up. \n\n2) Paid surveys. Yeah, all these companies with products are just itching to give away millions on research by giving every lucky participant a bundle of cash. Or a $500 gift card to your favorite retail store. Or a new laptop.\n\n3) Home-based data entry or typing. If they try to charge you a fee to get into their "training program" then it would probably be better to pass.\n\n4) Multi-level marketing. This actually comes in two flavors, scams, and legitimate opportunities. The latter can then be sub-divided into different groups, those that offer legitimate useful product at a reasonable cost, and those that have over-priced products just to pay all the people "bonuses" for signing up other people. \n\nI think #4 offers the best potential IF one can find an honest company with a product that offers value at a price so reasonable that "selling" it is a no-brainer. On top of that, the company should show integrity and maybe even have full financial disclosure right on the website to build the trust of customers and potential associates. \n\nSince I have yet to find such a company, I'm actually doing some brainstorming right this minute on what types of features a website should have to implement this.\n\nIn fact, I was almost about to post a question with a similar theme. If anybody wants to know more, and has a bit of talent in sales, teaching, or writing, feel free to give me a holler. I'd be glad to share details, get feedback, etc. Until then, best wishes for your search!

8	what am i doing wrong...all answers accepted by the way!? okay. so right now i am 22, dating a great guy yet somehow along the way we boh have changed which is human. we go to the same school/university and are each other's best friend and support. so what is the problem you ask, right? well, lately for some reason i am feeling so distant towards my bf, like sometimes it does not feel the same, i cannot pin point what it is but it is making me drift further and further from him and his love for the last 2 days. he puts so much of everything into this relationship and for me to act like this is not right! i feel as though there is a gap between us and it just keeps on filling until one day we will have nothing more to talk about! also, lately i have been taking everything very serious, more than before and i cannot take a joke for some reason! i have 4 weeks of school left and alot of stress, my bf is going thru some stuff of his own so i do not wan to make his life a pain and therefore i do not open up to him if i have a bad day or not! help It's all a part of life, friend... Changing & Growing.\n\nSeems like you have a lot of things happening in your life right now; school, a relationship, and personal priorities.\n\nThink of it this way: You have a meal on your plate consisting of meat and 2 side dishes. Do you eat all the meat and then the side dishes? Many people don't. Most sample a bit of each and wash it down with a beverage. Life is like that, too!\n\nWe "sample" different experiences at different phases of our lives and enjoy each of them - until they're gone. You have a wonderful friendship with this guy; surely one to savor. But is it the main mean (real love) or an appetizer (a sample of better things to come)? \n\nOnly the two of you will know - in time.\n\nHe is apparently undergoing the same changes right now. Just keep your friendship line open and things will flow as they should.\n\nSometimes, sweethearts become lifelong partners but many times, they don't. Just be there for him as his friend, relax, and see what happens. It appears that right now, love has to take a back seat for some of the other priorities both of you have got going on in each of your lives. Don't consider them as a deterioration of your love but, merely a distraction from it...\n\nKeep being honest and open with yourself and your boyfriend. In the end, it will solidify what truly forms the foundation of your relationship with each other.\n\nThanks for writing, my friend. Good Luck to both of you!
9	Anyone else see parallels between Political Correctness & the "Thought Police" from Orwell's "1984" A whole lot about the newly dawned 21st century is reminding me of 1984. \n\nThe whole "political correctness" thing can be anoying, but is the amongst the least of our problems.\n\nNow, time to quit thinking and worrying. Big Brother Bush will protect us, he will watch over us. He can not tell us WHY he needs to destroy our liberties, because to do so would comprimise our security. We must live at all costs, even at the expense of our personal freedoms and happiness.\n \nWe have to watch out, that evil Goldber...errr...I mean Bin Laden is gonna get us! He's under our bed, he's around every corner! \n\nDo not listen to those who say you have a better chance of getting hit by a car the next time you go out for a stroll then of being killed by a terrorist! They are Goldb...err....Bin Laden sympathizers!

4	what is 64 bit processor? In computer architecture, 64-bit is an adjective used to describe integers, memory addresses or other data units that are at most 64 bits (8 octets) wide, or to describe CPU and ALU architectures based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size.\n\n\nAs of 2004, 64-bit CPUs are common in servers, and have recently been introduced to the (previously 32-bit) mainstream personal computer arena in the form of the AMD64, EM64T, and PowerPC 970 (or "G5") processor architectures.\n\nAlthough a CPU may be 64-bit internally, its external data bus or address bus may have a different size, either larger or smaller, and the term is often used to describe the size of these buses as well. For instance, many current machines with 32-bit processors use 64-bit buses (e.g. the original Pentium and later CPUs), and may occasionally be referred to as "64-bit" for this reason. The term may also refer to the size of an instruction in the computer's instruction set or to any other item of data (e.g. 64-bit double-precision floating-point quantities are common). Without further qualification, however, a computer architecture described as "64-bit" generally has integer registers that are 64 bits wide and thus directly supports dealing both internally and externally with 64-bit "chunks" of integer data.

2	Will depression make a person nice one minute and hateful the next to the person they love? Yes. As someone who's dealt with depression personally, I can tell you that depression is not just sadness. Depression can also cause irritability and mood swings. \n\n"Depression is a treatable illness involving an imbalance of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. It is not a character flaw or a sign of personal weakness. You can’t make yourself well by trying to "snap out of it." Although it can run in families, you can’t catch it from someone else. The direct causes of the illness are unclear, however it is known that body chemistry can bring on a depressive disorder, due to experiencing a traumatic event, hormonal changes, altered health habits, the presence of another illness or substance abuse."\n\nSymptoms of Depression \n\nProlonged sadness or unexplained crying spells \nSignificant changes in appetite and sleep patterns \nIrritability, anger, worry, agitation, anxiety \nPessimism, indifference \nLoss of energy, persistent lethargy \nFeelings of guilt, worthlessness \nInability to concentrate, indecisiveness \nInability to take pleasure in former interests, social withdrawal \nUnexplained aches and pains \nRecurring thoughts of death or suicide

6	I'm thinking of investing in new orleans real estate to rent out 3+units less than $180,000 good idea or not? I am just interested in how hard is it to rent out a unit there and if it would be to  my advantage to buy property I could fix up and rent them out.  Or if property prices and taxes are too high so that it wouldn't be a real bargin.  thank you! I live in the New Orleans area.  Housing is SCARCE right now.  Many people are looking to rent, possibly short-term (12 mos. or so).  Property taxes are not that high, at least they weren't before Katrina, but then again, our streets, public service, and schools suck.\n\nIF you find any units, chances are you'll have to do some fixing up.  Need a contractor?  Get on a list and wait 3 or 4 months before they come out.  Doing it yourself?  Stand in line at Home Depot or Lowe's for an hour or so for each trip - IF they have what you want.\n\nI am not trying to discourage you - contrary to what you may think - I just want to paint a realistic picture for you.  My children's school just had their roof replaced from hurricane Katrina - in MARCH.  Times are tough... but we need people to help rebuild with us... and have lots of patience.  Good luck.

They do that by looking at families and ancient DNA.\n\nLet's say you have a type of gene that is passed down ONLY by your maternal family line, they can take blood/lymph samples from you, your mother, grandmother , great grandmother, aunts, great aunts whatever.\n\nIn reality this exists in your Mitochondrial DNA/RNA.\n\nIf you have a long family line like lets' say your ancestor was Charlemagne's sister or some famous person from whom they had tissue - hair / blood whatever. Usually they have to find relatively uncontaminated samples so tissue from roots of teeth or inside of large undamaged bone or if the tissues are in some other ways preserved. They enhance this DNA by making many copies of the tissue and then use that to do the comparison.\n\nThey can compare the genes from that old ancestor and see what kind of changes occur between the generations and your distant relative whom you know you are related to.\n\nThen you see what has changed between those older samples and the newer samples. That lets people know what the overall error or difference is. \n\nBy checking with everyone else or using multiple samples from multiple family tree's they compare and get a common set of changes between everyone. \n\nNow you can figure out the rate of change or put another way, how many years or how many generations is it before you can expect to see 1 error/change or 10 or 50 or 100. \n\nFor Mitochondrial RNA/DNA that is very well figured out and there is a great book about this subject called "The 7 Daughters of Eve".\n\nComparing the older DNA of a few individuals to people today has had some AMAZING results.\n\nFrom those results they have discovered some amazing facts,  For instance,\n\nHumanity was almost wiped out as a species 2 times in the last 200,000 years (most recently about 70,000 years ago) , scientists determined there were no more than 5,000 people left after some event caused the population to dwindle. \n\nIn a way the story of Adam and Eve were right,(if I remember correctly) although Eve lived 80,000 years ago in Africa somewhere and Adam lived 40,000 years ago in the European Steppe.\n\nAll women decend from no more than 7 individuals who lived at various times in the last 40,000 years.\n\nAfricans are the oldest branch of the human genetic tree and show almost 10 times more genetic diversity than their indoeuropean and asian cousins.
8	Im always shy in front of the girl that I love and she is kinda shy to what should we do to make it work.? give it time. eventually you two will become more comfortable around each other. as you become more familiar with each other, your encounters will become less awkward. just be patient with yourself and with her, and if your really love one another it will work itself out. try spending time in less public places if that makes you uncomfortable. try to find the setting that both of your are comfortable in and then just let things happen at a relaxed pace. ya'll will be fine. don't give up. seems you already have one important thing in common. good luck!

6	I live in Will Cty, IL, but I pay $4 per mnth in DuPage Cty CellPhone Tax. Noone in Cty ofc knows why. Do you? I called Sprint and they said even though I live in the Will County part of Naperville, I "show up in their system" as DuPage County. I called both counties tax offices and they were totally clueless about it. They referred me to the equally clueless Sprint. That is where the hub is set up for sprint. In that county. probably was before any set up for your exact area. Check to see if the area has a newer tax for your area. You can do this by calling the Public Utility Commisions in your area. You can also call Sprint and have them fill out a complaint form to find out why you pay a county tax for a different county and they will get it straightened out with the PUC for ya. Chances are if the number was established long ago then it ran out of a different county sector. Hope this helps.

But make sure you make a lot of folders to get there in case they are looking and it takes them a long time to get there.

0	Here is the REAL CONSPIRACY, do YOU think this is IT ??? 911 and all the terrorism is happening to shock us all and stress us out.\n\nBecause the people pulling the stringS ran this test bubble after 911 when they did the black out in New York.\n\nYou see there were no riots in New York during the black out people behaved themselves very well, they were helpful and respectful to each other. The opposite was the Rodney King riots where the police didn't even behave rationally and everyone went NUTS.\n\nWith 911 and the black outs in New York it proved, a methodology, how to use the image of an attacking enemy to galvanize a people and make them stronger, more rational in hard times.\n\nIt seems this is a method to prepare people for some GREAT SHOCK !!!\n\nAnd Europe is REALLY being galvanized right now.\n\nSOO the big questions is what are they preparing us for WHAT IS THAT SHOCKING INFORMATION OR DEED yet to come ??????

6	Where do you think would hire a 13 year old girl? O.k I am 13 years old, I understand that because of child labor laws most jobs are a no go. I was wondering i anyone knew of any where that would like hire me for something that can't fall under those laws? Like a library or petshop? I don't know its just my dad doesn't like the idea of me going out in our neighbor hood and making money on my own(too many creeps I guess) If you have any ideas let me know, thanks You are at a bad age for jobs, so you are going to have to take charge & run your own business. Babysit or Mother's Helper. Take Red Cross or YWCA course in baby CPR and get some credentials. Check w/churches in your area to see if they need helpers w/children. Build up a clientel slowly, after you build up your resume. Work on your own business card.By the time you are 16, you can hire other girls & train them! PS-anyone who hires you should not mind talking to you Dad first.

9	Is the U.S. government invading our liberties with these phone taps and what if they move on to bigger things? I had a discussion at school today about our government's infuences on us, filtering our political news, phone tapping..etc. When will it get bad enough for the american people to stand up and retaliate against what our government is doing? As a congressional candidate, I give you my answer:\n\nYes they are. The Fourth Amendment (and part of our Bill of Rights) states that there shall be no unreasonable search and seizure and that searches must have warrants. US Code also prohibits such wiretapping without a warrant issued by the court. It is ALL illegal that Bush is now doing. Just because he had his attorney general Gonzalez say it is legal--it is not. It would be as if his lawyer said it is now legal to rob banks with a gun. It is still illegal. \nThe FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) authorizes wiretaps and has oversight and accountability. What Bush is doing has no oversight and can easily be abused and is abused and used against innocent Americans. If there is not enough protest, you can be sure that Bush will move on to bigger things.

I want them to win right.  Go Dwyane Wade! The 3rd Son of Jor-el!  Oh yeah,    go Shaq....the 2nd Son of Jor-el!   Go HEAT!  GO! protests in sports never work..the outcome of a game is never changed....

0	How many children can a couple have without being greedy? An EXCELLENT question...\n\nConsidering current circumstances, I think having any more than two children is self-destructive, in both the personal sense (raising children isn’t easy) and in consideration of humans as a species.\n\nWe, as humans, have VASTLY overpopulated the earth to a dangerous extent. Through doing so, not only have we driven exponentially more animals to extinction than any other natural cause combined, but we are also driving OURSELVES to extinction by depleting our habitat - the entire planet - of natural resources and polluting the ones we do have. We all complain about death rates, but somehow our birth rates STILL exceed them. We complain about lack of food, shelter, necessities; we overcrowd our adoption centers and foster care systems with unwanted children or children of parents whom are unable to properly provide for them; and yet, if we were to STOP HAVING SO MANY CHILDREN these tragedies would slowly decrease and diminish all on their own.\n\nBy having more than two children, you are furthering the suffering of our species as a whole in lieu of your own selfish desire for more children. Only have as many children as will replace you and your partner when the TWO of you perish. After that, you are only contributing to the self-destruction of our species.

6	Do I have to wait to remove PMI? We've had insane appreciation on the homes in our area.  Base prices are now $40K higher than when we bought, I'm very certain with a new appraisal we'd have 20% equity already (been in the house for eight months).  Our lender states that we have to have the loan at LEAST two years.  This is true, or something they're forcing us to do?  Even if they do back down on that one, can't they say the 20% has to be off of the original price of the house, not the new appraisal value?  Refinancing with a new appraisal isn't an option with the rates having gone up and having paid two points at closing.  Do I have to abide by their rules and wait 2 years?  Other options? As Loan Administration Manager at a lending institution some years back, we would consider (and usually approve) deletion of mortgage insurance IF \na) the customer had a good payment history, \nb)  if he/she paid for a new appraisal -- from the appraiser of OUR choice AND\nc) the loan-to-value ratio (based on the new appraisal) was less than 80%.\nHowever, that was  number of years ago and times may have changed since then.  \nI would recommend that you contact your lender and make such a proposal.  The worst thing that can happen is that they will deny your request.

8	Any suggestions for potty training? My little guy just turned three years old. He will go potty each and every time I put him on the potty, but will never ask to go!!!! I have tried rewards, hugs and kisses and all the above. I know there is no cut off age to learn, but has any one ever heard of a three year old or older not trained yet? Boys are harder to train for some reason - and three is an average age for a boy (Ususally 2 for a girl).  Try asking him every hour or so if he's gone to the bathroom or needs to go.  Don't put him on the potty without asking if he has to go first, and then let him do as much as he can by himself without assistance.  Only help with things he struggles with (like buttoning pants) or asks for help for.   If you continue to ask him if he's gone, it will remind him if he needs to.  He may just not be used to realizing what it feels like to need to go potty before he actually goes.  Good luck.

3	what materials do i need to create a lunar eclipse for a science project at school? A simple quarter for every member of the class. Each person is to hold the quarter (representing the earth's shadow) at appropriate arms length to match the size of the moon and then slowly move it in front of the moon to simulate a lunar eclipse. It also works for solar eclipses but you need sunglasses to stare at the sun. :)

1	What are your thoughts on ozone?? (O3-O7)? ozone3 thru ozone7 involving medical cures. Any gas in too high of a concentration is deadly. Too much oxygen is bad for you too. A lightning bolt creates many times more ozone than the EPA says is dangerous to your health. The biggest lie about ozone is that it is pollution. Ozone destroys polution through oxidation. It is also created when the light from the sun interacts with our atmosphere. If a city is poluted the sun hitting our environment creates more ozone to deal with the polution. There are many good uses for ozone as long as you don't get too much of it. I have constantly been breathing ozone created by machine now for over two years. I have not had an allergy since. If you're getting too much ozone it smells like bleach and starts to irritate your nose and lungs. What may be too much for some may not even register to others.

5	Fantasy hockey question...? I'm in a Rotisserie league and wondering if I would be better off with a D man that has more PIM's?\n\nLike an idiot I took Joni Pitaken (he was so good last year) and this year he is Joni Pitiful. I could get someone like Witt who has lots more PIMs, less assists (3 vs 8) still no goals, but is a plus 3 vs Pitiful's -10.\n\nI'm never sure how to evaluate in fantasy.\n\nAny suggestions? I would hang in with Joni, but let's face it the Flyers are in big trouble--if precedent follows the second I dump Joni he'll score goals and jump up high in the rankings.\n\nNot a huge Islander fan but Nolan will have these guys scrapping and playing better than Philly, don't cha think?\n\nThanks for any help you can offer! \n\n\nSorry I had to repost I only got one answer and it wasn't helpful.  thanks again! Look, if you need PIM's, getting a goon defencemen is your best choice. Leave the scoring to the forwards and the PIM's to your defencemen. You got the right idea with Witt, I have him on my team for the exact same reason and am killing 15 other friends in my rotisserie league.
5	In the new tennis challenge rule, is the player allowed to seek help from others to decide (like NFL coaches)? If the answer is no, I think this would be very difficult to enforce and could be controversial on a big point. In theory, no.  The player and the player alone is supposed to decide whether or not to challenge a call.\n\nIn reality, we all can see that coaches and even fans can have an influence on decisions made by the player on whether or not to challenge.\n\nIf you watch the umpire, they will say "It's your decision to challenge or not challenge".  They get no assistance from courtside.\n\nBut just wait and watch.  Abuses will begin to crop up here and there.

4	why i cant access my router, 192.168.1.1, anymore? Keep getting unauthorized access.? ?  IP change...uh NO, that will not cause this error,\nif the Router's IP addres has changed then you will simply NOT CONNECT to it at all---page cannot be loaded. If you are not on the same subnet as the Router, and it is not your GATEWAY, then you also will not connect to it----page cannot be loaded.\n\n"unauthorized access"\nIs only generated because the wrong username / password combination has been attempted 3 times.  Many Routers do not require a 'username', just a password.  \n\nIf you changed it from the default, then you will have to find it, or performe a 'Reset', (not just unplugging the power,) to return all the Router settings to the Factory defaults.  This means the Router will need to be programmed as it was before, in order for it to work again.  \n\nOnce you have 'reset' it, then the documentation that came with it, should have the default password.  \n\nthere are websites that have the defaults listed if you know the model # of your Router.  here is the one I use:\n\nhttp://www.phenoelit.de/dpl/dpl.html

9	Why aren't Americans concerned with Dick Cheney's 1.9 Million Dollar Tax return as Vice President? I was always taught that this was illegal. When did the laws change, this year? A tax return is clearly stated by the IRS as earned income, and I know that 1.9 million is over the limits for a President let alone the Vice President. This has always been a scandal within politics, and the ranks of Congress. I couldn't care less about Cheney's donations to the Republican party, since none of it went to people that really needed it the most. I am sure this will come up as a topic of discussion when Congress changes this fall.

5	who is marco van basten? Marco van Basten\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\nMarco van Basten  \nFull name Marcel van Basten \nNickname(s) San Marco \nDate of birth October 31, 1964 \nPlace of birth Utrecht, Netherlands \nCurrent club Netherlands \nPosition Manager (former Striker) \nYouth club(s) \n1981-1982 Ajax Amsterdam \nProfessional club(s) \n1982-87\n1987-93 Ajax Amsterdam\nA.C. Milan 132 (127)\n147 (90) \nNational team \n1983-92 Netherlands 58 (24) \nManaged club(s) \n2003-2004\n2004- Ajax B\nNetherlands \nMarcel van Basten, known as Marco van Basten (October 31, 1964, Utrecht), is a former Dutch football player who played for Ajax Amsterdam and A.C. Milan in the 1980s and early 1990s. He is regarded as one of the finest strikers of all time and scored 276 goals in a career cut short by injury, known for his strength on the ball, his tactical awareness and spectacular volleys. His grace earned him the titles "San Marco" and "The Swan Of Utrecht". Van Basten, who was named European Footballer of the Year three times (1988, '89 and '92) and FIFA World Player of the Year (1992) is currently the coach of the Dutch national team.\n\n[edit]\nPlaying career\nVan Basten played very briefly for Elinkwijk before Ajax signed him. He played his first game for Ajax in April 1982 and was proclaimed the new Johan Cruijff.\n\nIn 1987 Silvio Berlusconi brought Van Basten to Milan along with fellow countrymen Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard, joining them in 1988. In his first season Milan won their first scudetto (league championship) in eight years, but Van Basten played only eleven games and was constantly troubled by an ankle injury. Despite this, in Euro 88 Van Basten showed a dazzling run of form, including three goals against England and a spectacular volley in the final against the Soviet Union.\n\nHelped by his form in international competition, Van Basten had an excellent season in 1988-89, winning European Footballer of the Year and scoring nineteen goals in Serie A as well as helping Milan demolish Steaua Bucharest to win the European Cup. In 1989-90 he was Capocannoniere (Serie A's leading goal scorer) and Milan defended their European Cup successfully. The Dutch national side had a very poor World Cup in 1990, finally going out to West Germany in the second round.\n\nMilan's 1990-91 European season was ruined in the semi-final against Olympique Marseille and the club received a year long ban from European football. Van Basten had been banned for four matches earlier in the competition following a cynical elbowing offense. Domestically the club's season was also disappointing and Sampdoria won the scudetto. Van Basten fell out with Milan's manager Arrigo Sacchi and Berlusconi sacked Sacchi to placate him. Undistracted by European football in 1991-92 and managed by Fabio Capello, Milan did not lose a single game in the league and won the championship, Van Basten scoring 25 goals and becoming Capocannoniere again. Internationally the Dutch went out of Euro 92 to Denmark in a penalty shootout, Van Basten missing one.\n\nMilan stretched their unbeaten run into the 1992-93 season, going 58 matches in total before they lost a game. Van Basten played exceptionally well in the early part of the season and was voted European Player of the Year for a third time before his troublesome ankle injury recurred in a game against Ancona. Van Basten underwent another in a series of operations and returned to Milan for the final few domestic games before they lost the Champions League final to Marseille. The final was Van Basten's final game for Milan; despite enormous effort, he was unable to recover from his injuries.\n\n[edit]\nCoaching career\nVan Basten officially left Milan in 1995 and retired from football, stating he would never try management. However, he eventually realized that football was too important for him and successfully took a course with the Royal Netherlands Footba
0	Will having one black family in my neighborhood bring down the whole neighborhood's value? Well, I'm only 17, I'm not selling a house or anything ( Duh. ) But there is this family that moved in my neighborhood and they're black. The houses are really expensive and I was just wondering will that one family bring down the whole neighborhood value? Because I've seen this happen before..Green Island Hills..yeah no one wants to move over there anymore..Why do they have to ruin such good, influential and well mannered neighborhoods? \n\nEdit: I did ask this in the Business section, but I think only black people were answering the question, since the answers were a little race-biased. Having a black family in your neighborhood will not bring anyone's neighborhood value down.  Sadly enough, usually when a black family moves in, you will find out who the biggest bigot is first.  Because they will be the first to leave.  By you being 17 years old, you have a chance to educate yourself and not fall prey to ignorance.  Sadly enough, these people are the first to enter the church on Sundays.  Why would anyone think that God would allow anyone into Heaven that does not love their brother and sister(regardless of the skin color)?     Arm yourself with knowledge before you buy into stereotypes that have been passed down from generation to generation.  After all, where you will spend eternity depends on you.

9	How stupid do they think we are? There are two debates on the Senate bill, one in the press, one not. What? do you think of the 'prevailing wage' issue? Big business wants to flood legal immigration going forward and get cheap labor to depress wages. But they insist the jobs are those 'Americans won't do'. Idea is they have to show Americans won't do them before they can get fresh guest workers. At the last minute the Senate added a rule that that has to be at 'the prevailing wage' a law used to govern fair wages at Federal sites. Poor big business knows they won't be able to exploit cheap labor as much that way and is trying to say (behind the scenes) that the fair wage law is unfair because American workers often make less than that, since the standard applies only to government jobs. So, construction workers etc. out there, is it unfair to you to say new guest workers can't be brought in unless paid the prevailing wage?  I'm not in construction, so I'm curious as to how you feel. i feel like were getting bent over by the politicians...\n\nthe lower the politicians and big companies can make wages, the less citizens will want those jobs and thats when they can say we wont take them...\n\nif illegal aliens were deported those jobs would have to pay higher or go away to mechanization...\n\nthe way it is now, illegals are stopping our kids and low income people from taking those entry level jobs...\n\nin construction, illegals working under the table make it cheaper for a company to build something and therefore more competitive and profitable than a company that plays by the rules...

0	How do you reconcile the existence of other religions with your own beliefs? Even even Christianity, which has the largest following of any religion, claims only 1/3 of the world.  This means that 2/3 of the world disagrees!  How do you reconcile in your own mind the fact that there is a huge range of beliefs?  There is more than one religion, even, that claims to be the One True Religion.  How do you explain that, and how do your own beliefs support that explanation?  Even athiests are not excused from the question, since most of the world believes in some concept of God and/or life after death. Religious Conviction\n--------------\nI am Christian\nI believe in god\nI am one with him\nI believe in heaven and hell\n--------------\nI am Jewish\nI believe in god\nI am one with prayer\nI believe our savior is still coming\n-------------\nI am Hindu\nI believe in many gods\nI am one with my eternal soul\nI believe that all religions lead to the same path but in different ways\n-------------\nI am Buddhist\nI believe in reincarnation\nI am without desire in my life\nI believe in meditation to reach enlightenment\n------------\nI am Muslim\nI believe in prayer\nI am with the all mighty Allah\nI believe in the five pillars of Muhammad\n------------\nI am Atheist\nI believe in nothing\nI am one for anything\nI believe that Im in control of my own destiny\n-------------\nI am Satanist\nI believe in pleasure\nI am one with fulfillment\nI believe all my pleasure should be granted\n-------------\nI am Wiccan\nI believe in nature\nI am one with the elements around me\nI believe we are all connected and bound together by energy,\n\nI am Unitarian\nI believe in faith\nI am one with all things\nI believe we all can live in happiness through love\n\nthe above post was not mine it was from a spiritual group.\n\n\n\nBy keeping an open mind and heart, If we're all living here on earth and most of the messages coming from the spirit are of love and peace and awareness, then why argue?

I'm wanting to raise my HDL levels and Lower my LDL levels and I get these answers to eat more fatting foods to raise my entire cholesterol some of these people don't know that there is a "Good" and a "Bad" cholesterol.  You want your good to be high and your bad to be low. Unfortunately, some people are just jerks.  They try to be mean to others to feel better about themselves.  Sometimes, though, people ask questions that are just asking for a smart-mouth response like "What is 2+2?" or "Where is the question mark key?", but your cholesterol question is not one of those.

5	who is better Larry Johnson, LaDainian Tomlinson or Tiki Barber? LT without a doubt. LJ had a good year last year, but I'm not convinced he's all that great. Tiki isn't a consistant running back. LT has the whole package, he can run (of course), block, and catch (had a 100 rec. season 2003).

This trust shall be revocable at any time by Jones during his lifetime by the execution and recording of a Revocation of Trust so providing, but in the event he does not do so then upon his death said real property shall be sold by smith and the net proceeds thereof shall be distributed by right of representation to the issue of Jones including George Lee Jackson or his issue the same as if he were the natural child of Jones.

They do make it very hard to get it off your computer. You can disable it but its still there and every now and then it just manages to get it self active again. Pain in the butt. \nI use TuneUp Utilities.  http://www.tune-up.com/products/tuneup-utilities/ \n It was the only way I found to get rid of it. It will completely remove it from your system, (it also does all this nice fine tuning, speeds things up, registry cleaners etc.)\nGreat program that you can download and try for free. Then, if you like it pay for it, if you don't, remove it.

They are jealous.\nThey wish they could be as good as The Yankees always are.
6	what is the specific gravity of grvel, sand? Gravity affects every single object on Earth in the same way, by a pull of approximately 9.8 meters/sec squared, of course you have to take into account wind resistance, therefore an object such as a truck going off a building will drop slower than that of a baseball because the wind resistance will affect the truck more. So sand, gravel, the specific gravity is 9.8 meters/sec ( in a vaccuum, meaning where there is absolutely no air resistance but since places that this aren't normal you have to assume wind resistance.)

1	I would like to know about stem cell. My child is 5 year old and is it is possible to preseve stem cell? for her. I want to know if we plan for next child then it is possible to use of stem cell (second chid) for first child.\nBecause I read that only birh time stem cell can be preserve.\n\nAlso i want to know application of stem cell. Whar part of our body can be regenerate by stem cell? Stem cells in animals and humans are primal undifferentiated cells that retain the ability to divide and differentiate into some, or all other, cell types. (The equivalent in higher plants are meristematic cells.) Stem cells have the potential to act as a repair system for the body, because they can divide and differentiate, replenishing other cells as long as the host organism is alive.\n\nFor more information about stem cell, u should visit:\nhttp://stemcells.nih.gov/
1	how to trisect an angle? Like an straightangle can easily be trisected .How to trisect an angle other than a straight angle? You can't trisect with an unmarked straightedge and compass. It *can* be done with a marked straightedge and compass. The key is being able to *slide* the marked straightedge. Here's how it goes:\n\nStep I: Draw a circle with radius equal to the length of the mark on the straightedge and with center the corner, O, of the angle you want to trisect. Let the sides of the angle meet the circle at A and B.\n\nStep II: Extend the line OA through the other side of the circle.\n\nStep III: Place the straightedge so that one mark is on the extended line OA, one mark is on the circle and so that the edge goes through the point B. This is the step that is impossible without the marks on the straightedge. Let the intersection with the extended line OA be at the point C.\n\nThen the angle ACB will trisect the angle AOB.
0	Have you ever had personal experience with a haunting - ghost, poltergeist, etc? I heard somebody downstairs making repeated loud whistling noise in the middle of the night.  It woke me from my sleep.  When I would move to walk towards it, the noise stopped.  When I stopped, the noise would start again. This went on for about 10 minutes and scared me quite badly. I called 911.  The police arrived and searched the house.  They couldn't find anyone, and the noise did not recur -- until they left the house.  The exact moment the police car backed out of the driveway, the whistling noise started again.  Since I knew nobody was in the house, I tracked it down by walking towards it, stopping and then waiting for it to start again.  It was my daughter's Care Bear Castle, which operates on batteries.  I can understand a toy malfunctioning, but can't explain the timing of it starting and stopping, especially during the whole 20 minutes the police were in the house.  I think a poltergeist was playing with it!!  \nHow about you, any ghosts at your place? Well I don't know if it was a ghost or a spirit or maybe just an energy, but I had an interesting experience a couple of years ago.  I was living at my parent's house at the time and they were away for the weekend so I was home alone.  I had a friend come over to my house and we were just hanging out, drinking some wine and chatting.  We finished the bottle of wine and I placed the empty bottle on the kitchen table next to a candle I was planning to put in it.  We decided to go out to meet some people and came back about 2 hours later.  When I opened the front door I saw the candle was placed in the neck of the bottle AND IT WAS LIT with only one drip of wax running down the side.  I had an alarm set with motion detectors when I left the house.  These candles burned very quickly, so it must have been lit just moments before I got home.  I'm so glad I had a friend with me to vouch for it because no one believes it when they ehar it.  Funny thing is, it was almost comforting to me because I think it was my grandmother telling me she was there to watch over me.  I felt very peaceful for a while after that happened.  I've been waiting for something like it to happen ever since, I have a fascination with it.

2	Why is that when we sit in airconditioned place after exercising or sweating a bit, we feel sleepy? Whenever i go work out, or sweat in the sun for some reason, why is that i feel sleepy/drowsy? Is there any medical or logical reason for this. Sources would be appreaciated. People naturally sleep better in a cold room or when the body becomes suddenly cold. This is due to part of your circadian rhythm. In addition to sleep naturally being effected by light (your internal clock, the superchiasmatic nucleus, is located near the optic chiasm where the optic nerves cross); most humans will wake easier by the light of the sun and sleep easier in the dark, there is also sleep regulation based on body temperature. \n\nThe human core body temperature changes slightly throughout a day. At around 3 AM the body temperature is at its lowest. It starts to rise until near noon when it plateus and even dips a little bit (this results in people getting tired around lunch time...not because of the lunch itself, after all, you don't get tired after eating breakfast or dinner). Many populations, such as Mexico, take into account this normal fatigue and allow workers to nap (siesta) around that time. Afternoon the body starts rising in temperature again until around 8 PM when it begins to fall again overnight.
2	I have become more distracted, fogetful, no logical thinking, could this be a sign of depression? Abscent mindedness, as if no care in the world, no logical thinking through stuff, a mild form of dislexia (reverse spelling), it is affecting my home and working environment, should i be worried about mental aflictions? The short answer is that yes, it could be a sign of depression, but only if combined with several other factors.  I would advise you to go to the doctor and get checked out for physical problems - then if none are found, you should probably go to a psychiatrist for a consultation.  In addition, a full battery of psychological testing would be a good idea, if possible.  Check out the link below for the signs of depression - you have to have 4 or 5 most of the time, for at least 2 weeks, without a situational cause.

2	how can i look confident even when im not? A big part of confidence is in the way you carry yourself.  Stand up straight.  Think of a straight line going up your legs and spine straight to the top of your head and align your stance to it.  Smile when you see people, and look them in the eye (briefly, don't stare).  Think of yourself as the confident person you want to be, and imagine the positive reactions of those around you.  Make a practice of this regularly.  You may not only find this enjoyable, but there is scientific evidence it actually works to boost confidence in people who practice it regularly.  Good luck!

0	Where in the bible does it say that Mary Magdalene was ever a prostitute? I have seen on the news that Mary Magdalene was not ever a prostitute.  The Catholic church at some point began describing her that way for whatever reason.  So I've heard.  Is it in the bible? VISIT :\n\nhttp://africanamerica.org/groupee/forums?m=63070547&a=tpc&cdra=Y&s=60260642&f=40070883D\n\nAND/OR READ:\n\n\n\nThis is exactly the kind of hostile rejection that the prominent role of women in the early church has faced for hundreds of years.\n\nCanon Edward Norman, a noted Church historian in England, has defined this as a struggle between "dubious feminist theology" and "rigorous \nscholarship."\n\nNotice that Norman says that the only things we know about Mary Magdalene come from the Gospels. Yet, he goes on to say that what we have there is an \naccount of a "repentant ex-prostitute" who became a faithful follower of Jesus. If anyone's theology is dubious here it is Norman's. It is a fact that the Bible does not say that Mary Magdalene was ever a prostitute. I pointed this out in my essay. Yet, Norman can blatantly say that the Gospels portray her as a repentant ex-prostitute. Even as he is saying that "there is no other source" of knowledge about Mary Magdalene other than the Bible, he strongly asserts that she was an ex-prostitute even though that notion comes to us from extrabiblical noncanonical sources.\n\nRigorous scholarship reveals that there is no reference to Mary Magdalene as a prostitute at all in the Bible. If anything, "dubious traditionalist theology" has thought it important enough to label Mary Magdalene as a \nprostitute even though the Gospels do not say that. It is the traditionalist view that engages in much speculation about Mary Magdalene. It is kind of \namazing when you think of all the stories, homilies, and sermons that go on and on about Magdalene the "penitent whore." Most people think that this \ncomes from the Bible simply because it has been repeated so often.\n\nTraditionalist church historians have no problem believing sources outside of the Scriptures IF those sources do not challenge their own notions. For \nexample, most of them teach that Paul was beheaded by the Romans between 66-69 AD. They teach that Peter was crucified upside down. They teach that \nJohn lived to be 90 or 100 years old in exile. ALL of this information comes to us from noncanonical writings. And they are all probably true. However, noncanonical writings that challenge their own ideas are quickly and \nsummarily discredited and not even seriously discussed.\n\nMy point is that traditionalist scholars like Norman seem to believe that they are unbiased and objective while the scholars that they don't agree with are biased, slanted, and pushing an agenda with ulterior motives. In fact, we can see from Norman's statements that he seems to be pushing an agenda himself. He seems intent on perpetuating this image of Mary Magdalene \nas an ex-prostitute even though he knows that the Scripture says no such thing. And yet he says that this account comes from the Gospels!! He KNOWS \nthat the Bible says no such thing. Well, I'm assuming that he knows. If he doesn't, then he can't be much of a church historian.\n\nIt is "dubious traditionalist theology" that maintains that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute even though the Bible does not say that. It is the same "dubious traditionalist theology" that maintains that the Beloved Disciple is St. John even though the Bible does not say that either.\n\nThe traditionalist view(s) are NOT free of all bias. Therefore, it is fair to scrutinize widely held beliefs even if they have been believed for a long \ntime.\n\n\n\n\n1830 ~ 1912 \n\nby Patricia Chadwick\nwww.historyswomen.com \n\nThe name “Mary Magdalene” can evoke different images to various people. Many see her as a deranged woman suffering from being possessed by demons, while others view her as a fallen woman, even a prostitute. Although the Biblical record is not silent on the matter, we are only given a few details about the life of Mary Magdalene in the Bible - and you may be surprised what the Scripture do

4	do you think powerbook is still better than macbook pro? Yes and No.\n\nFor the average user, the new MacBook Pro offers faster startup time and many applications that are designed for the new (to Apple) Intel processor that will run faster than before.  \n\nThis is one side of the story.  Many computer users choose Apple for use in design projects ranging from graphics to film editing.  Applications like Apple's own Final Cut Pro, Motion, and non Apple programs like Photoshop (Macromedia)  will most likely run faster on the older Powerbook G4s because they are not written to work natively with Intel processors.  This does not mean these programs will not work on the MacBook Pro, they will just run slower because they require a special (invisible) program to allow them to run on the Intel processor.  \n\nFor the average user, however, the MacBook Pro is well worth it.

0	Why are people today so confused about their gender roles and identity? Isn't confusion the first thing that Satan wants for us in his plan to try to drag us all down to hell with him? You know, most people are not confused about their role or identity - usually if there is confusion it is on the part of society with the role or identity an individual assumes.  It's a wide and wonderful world and it is great that each of us can be and try anything we like - and every experience comes with a great lesson or bit of wisdom.  \n\nAnd personally, I think the Enemy is our own self doubt and fears - we drag our own selves down enough, just look around.  We don't need a horned little imp to make our lives hell, very often we do a fine job all on our own.

4	Where can I download the file DAO36.exe ? (Data access object)? It´s from Microsoft. The answer isn't likely what you'd want to hear.  From the first site listed below, it is apparent that the Jet/DAO components and applications are not supported fully any longer.  That leaves you with a couple of not so good options.\nFirst, do a file search on the internet and download a few copies.  Make a survey of the file size and get a consensus so that you are fairly sure it isn't a tampered file.  Virus scan it very thoroughly and then install it.  Second option, find and purchase an older copy of a Microsoft programming product that will have the redistributable included on the CD.  This will cost you and you should only use an obviously factory produced CD for the same reasons I advised the gyrations with the downloaded file from option one.  If you do get it and it is critical to your system, be sure and archive it in two or three places and keep the media safe, sound and separate.  The third option is to download the MDAC 2.8 package and hope that it supports enough "deprecated" calls to work with your software.  I hope that this helps you out and wish you luck.

2	what is the latest treatment for goiter and what food can help in its treatment? The goiter worries my landlord's wife. I just want to help her get some answers to this question.\nPlease help her. Hello,\n\nShe should go see a medical doctor first!! Her MD will run tests to find our WHY she has the goitre and will be able to advise her about surgery, medications, dietary and lifestyle changes.\n\nIf the MD is not helpful, she should DEFINITELY consult a **registered dietician** (NOT a 'nutritionist' or a non-accredited 'diet specialist').\n\nFor your information:\n\nOur thyroid uses Iodine to create important hormones (T3, T4). She needs to be very careful about her Iodine intake (ie iodized salt, seafood). Since her thyroid is enlarged, it may be like a giant sponge for Iodine and this can be **dangerous** if her Iodine intake is increased too quickly.\n\nNext, she would be very wise to limit her intake of soy and cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, kale, kohlrabi, Brussels sprouts, etc). Scientific studies have demonstrated that these foods interfere with Iodine uptake by the thyroid. For the same reason, avoiding products with 'rapeseed' is important too. It is very, very difficult to find any foods or oils that contain rapeseed now so this shouldn't be a major concern.\n\nALSO, she should ** NOT become pregnant**; it puts a major stress on her body AND her children will have major birth defects (known as cretinism).\n\nHope this helps!\n:)

6	What would be the best name for a new fast food place and what would be the main food? Ex: burger, taco? "The Way"  \n\nWould be walk in and drive through.\n\nWould serve fresh fruit, yougurt, healthy breads and fresh veggie and fruit juices in the mornings, in the afternoon it would offer an array of veggies, good carbs, healthy oils and fresh protiens (soy, fish, chicken, buffallo, beef...) and to up the ante for dinner, I would add dine-in multi course meals as oppossed to the traditional 'food on a tray', comprised of the same high quality fresh food.  It wouldn't either cater to Carnivores, Vegetarians or Vegans in particular.... simply offer the convenience of quality food for those that haven't the time to prepare it themselves.  \n\nAnd yes, I do think there is a market out there, even though the costs may be more than some are willing to pay.

1	why do rain drops have the specific shape they have?? Everyone says that The surface tension causes the drop to be spherical. But how? and Why?\n\nLets explain surface tension first-\nIn an air-water interface, the molecules that are close to the surface are attracted by fewer molecules of the liquid than the ones that are NOT close to the surface. The former thus, has less attractive potential energy than the latter, right?\n\nNow, for any matter (solid or liquid), attractive potential energy results in stability & repulsive energy results in instablity. Right?\n\nSo, it is energetically unfavourable to have a surface for a liquid (or solid) as it results in loss of attractive potential energy.\n\nNow, for that reason, a drop tends to have the lowest possible surface area to remain stable. Now, using some high level mathematics, we can find out that a sphere has the lowest possible surface area for a given volume. (it is better than a cube atleast).\n\nHence why we can see that the water bubbles and drops tend to be spherical. \n\nBUT, as gravity pulls the drop downwards, it looks like the way it does. Due to the distortion by the pull of gravity, the drops appear somewhat oval in shape but, in the absense of gravity, all the liguid-air surfaces tend to be spherical.\n\nI hope it helped.\nHave a nice day!

Any suggestions on how I go about doing that? You should check your grandfather's will, and try to get in contact with any lawyers or accountants/financial advisors that may have worked with your grandfather (especially anyone who helped him with his will, if he had one). Also, it might be wise to look for old tax returns.

1	Was there a crazy weather pattern affecting radio reception in the Mid-Atlantic on Saturday, June 10th, 2006? It was June 10th.I was sitting at home(Staunton, VA) listening to the radio (I have a Philips AZ1574) and something very strange happened.I was listening to 89.9 and I decided to flip the dial around to see what else was playing.I turned to 89.7 and heard a station I had never heard before (and I know just about every single station receivable in the Augusta County area).I thought it might be the one from Richmond, but it sounded different, and it that didn't seem right, anyway, because we usually get Radio IQ from Charlottesville on that frequency.Then there was a different station on 88.3. 93.9, 95.3, 96.3, and on and on they kept coming in.  Stations I had never heard of starting with the letter K.I could hear them clear enough, and I could tell what songs were being played, but I just didn't know who they were or where they were from, until I hit 102.3 and an ID said "Nebraska's Hot Country Y02."I couldn't ID any other stations but many of them matched stations in Missouri & Texas. Disturbances in layers of the upper atmosphere allow TV and FM band signals to travel through "ducts" for several hundred miles.  Sunrise, sunset, and some weather patterns can set up temperature inversions that bend signals back to earth 100-200 miles beyond their source.  On rare occasions the ionospheric layers hundreds of miles up become dense enough to reflect TV and FM signals back to earth--500 to several thousand miles away from their source.  This last kind of DX mechanism is commonplace at lower frequencies.
9	Secondhand smoke in a pregnant waitress? Okay, here's a new look on the smoking ban. Say a yong mom waitresses at a local Denny's to earn extra cash. She and her husband have a second child. While she's working, any exposure her "fetus" has to secondhand smoke is dangerous. Should she be forced to quit her job to get away from smoke, or risk her child having birth defects or SIDS? The dangers of secondhand smoke have been proven. Hurting your own body with alcohol or drugs is one thing, sitting next to a smoker is another. If smokers were given a seprate room, would a smoking ban be so bad? Don't I have a right to enjoy my meal wihout breathing in smoke? I have lived in an area where there is a total smoking ban in restaurants and bars...actually any public place and it's great.  The way I look at it I have a RIGHT to breathe smokers need to respect that right.  In Ottawa there was a case where a waitress who had never smoked developed lung cancer...it was one of the things that influenced the smoking ban.\n\nIn short I think that Yes you have the right to enjoy your meal without breathing in smoke. \n\nI also don't understand when they say that denying smoking would hurt business.  I know my friends and I ... all non smokers go out much more now that we know we won't come home smelling of second hand smoke.

2	how do u get a bacertia infection? i had one Some bacteria are harmless. Your skin, mouth, bowels and other places are filled with them. Many are even necessary to your survival because they help digest food or keep infectious organisms at bay. Cows could not digest grass without bacteria in their stomachs. The troublemakers are the ones that are able to make harmful chemicals that act like acids or poisons. Botulism, for instance, is caused by a bacterial poison. Pus, for the most part, is the body's response to illness. It's a collection of white cells that the body recruits for an area of infection. At other times, bacteria are so irritating to your system that your own body's defenses go overboard and attack not only the bacteria but also the tissues that host them.\n\nHow do I know I have a bacterial infection?\n\nBacterial infection usually makes you noticeably sick, whether it's an infected ingrown toenail or bloody diarrhea. Sometimes, however, they produce very little awareness but still can go on to cause immense trouble. Sexually transmitted disease, for instance, can be very subtle and can leave you infertile before you know what hit you. Even if an infection is obvious, it often takes a modern laboratory to identify the exact germ and, more important, tell the doctor what to use to treat it. Most bacteria can be grown in the laboratory and tested for their reaction to different antibiotics. This is why the doctor wants to collect a specimen from your infection, wherever it is.\n\nMany infections produce inflammation, a process generated mostly by your immune system, which appears as redness from an increased blood supply, swelling from fluid accumulating in the tissues, pain from nerve irritation, and heat, both localized warmth and generalized fever.

2	how are other people at risk after radio active iodine treatment? i have gone through radio active iodine treatment..i want to know how people around me are at risk.. what will happen to them if exposed You can actually contaminate others with the radiation. However the risk is small and it depends on how much radiation therapy you recieved as well. \n\nRadio Active Iodine (RAI) is passed out of the body through all bodily fluids such as stool, urine, saliva and sweat therefore these are all potential forms of contamination. \n\nRadiation exposure is directly related to the amount of time you spend with another person as well as how intimate and close your contact is with them. Avoid prolonged, intimate physical contact with babies, children and pregnant women. \n\nFor a pretty easy site to follow, try http://cpmcnet.columbia.edu/dept/thyroid/raiprep.html\n\nGood luck with your treatment and get well soon!

9	what is your opinion on sepeperate telangana state? Till the country was divided on the basis of caste, religion and creed but now it seems that some greedy people are dividing India on the basis of boundries and regions. Is it not enough for these kind of people that they are living in a country, trying hard to feed over its 1 billion public. \nsome time, the sound of some like minded faces become so strong that it looks that it repersents the whole community.I am sure that if done a survey in Telangana region, the demand of any\nnew state would not a issue with majority of the people.\nfirst of all they want employment and resources. they have nothing to do with o old state or new state. \nTheir repersentatives should negotiate with the union govenrmnent for some economic and social assistance rather than screaming the demand for seperate state.\nManmohan Singh was quite right when he did not adhere to the demands of its local politican Rao, who was alliance Party for making UPA, for conferring Telgana a  seperate state. but for how long, the UPA would not oblidge his demand. I have had apprehension in the mind that perhaps the congress could grant it a status to meet its both ends near the 2009 general elections. \nIn my view,this demand would achieve nothing. it would not only augument the administration budget of government but surely would divide the nation and foment the similar demand in other parts of the country.\nI just put a simple example- we always say unity is the strengh but what we are thinking or doing- Just smashing and crushing that unity amidst some self-inflicted motives.\nIf that area has had some problems then it could be sorted out with a suitable planning. A layout or a rehablitation plan could be chalk out for bring back its prosperity.
1	what do you know  about gravity ? It seems that every object has its own gravity, or attractiveness to other bodies. Scientists are still puzzled about gravity, but it seems that the larger the mass of an object, the larger the gravity. The further away from the object, the lesser the attractive force.\n\nAlso...human beings and all other animals on Earth evolved to operate effectively in the gravity on the surface of the planet. When we are in less gravity environments or greater gravity environments for extended periods, the body experiences ill effects. For example, in weightlessness, the body loses muscle mass and bone mass. We need our Earth gravity.

5	Why do people wear sweatbands around there calf? Other than looks, it is used to protect scrapes, cut and bruises if there are any.   Also, it provides warmth to the area that is more convenient than wearing tights completely underneath the shorts.   Players also wear them to give their calf more pressure, that helps them feel more comfortable especially if the calf/shin area has had surgery performed in the area (the surgery may have caused lossed sensitivity).  Lastly, some players wear them because of superstition.

2	sexual abuse... by a female? My cousin's best friend was sexually and physically abused when she was 10 by another female. I can't see how a female is capable of such actions, is it really true that females are just as capable of sexual abuse as guys? It just really weirds me out... I hope that so-called 'female' is locked up for life. Sure .. a woman is capable.. sexual abuse isn't just about a man forcing a girl/woman to have sex...  sexual abuse involved anything that one person does to another person against their will that involves any kind of sexual act... touching..  making somebody remove their clothes for the purpose of looking at them... making the person touch the one doing the forcing.. and much more...  so, if this woman made your friend touch her..  or she touched your friend.. in any manner considered sexual, it's sexual abuse.. that includes kissing.. and can include some types of hugging...  could be in some countries the laws are somewhat different... but I believe in Canada and the USA, the laws are similar. I hope your friend files charges if she really feels she was abused.

4	completely lost music on computer, but saved it all on CD's. want to rip music but only title is showing? is there a program that reads text and artist. dont want to type artists names all over again mp3, wma, m4a, or regular audio CDs?\n\nIf they're regular audio CDs, too bad man, because the info's gone.  Try ripping it with the program you used to burn it, maybe it will remember the info.\n\nI believe that a jukebox CD like mp3, m4a, or wma would keep the information with the song, so all you have to do is pop it into the CD drive, select all the songs, and drag and drop them where you want them to go on your PC.  The computer will then copy them from the disc to your hard drive.  Hopefully the ID3 tags (title, artist, album, genre, etc.) are still attached.\n\nIf they were data CDs, then you're lucky, because the info would definitely be with the songs.  just copy them back to your hard drive.

We start by using implicit differentiation:\n\nx² - 2y² = 2\n2x - 4y dy/dx = 0\ndy/dx = x/(2y)\n\nDifferentiating a second time:\n\nd²y/dx² = (2y - 2 dy/dx x)/(4y²)\n\nSubstituting the value we already have for dy/dx:\n\nd²y/dx² = (2y - 2 x/(2y) x)/(4y²)\nd²y/dx² = (2y - x²/y)/(4y²)\n\nSolving the original equation for x²:\n\nx² - 2y² = 2\nx²=2+2y²\n\nAnd substituting:\n\nd²y/dx² = (2y - (2+2y²)/y)/(4y²)\nd²y/dx² = (2y - 2/y - 2y)/(4y²)\nd²y/dx² =  (-2/y)/(4y²)\nd²y/dx² =  -1/(2y³)\n\nd²y/dx² = -1/2 * y^(-3)\n\nso a=-1/2 and b=-3

Losing someone you love anyway is sad,

1	Please answer this chem problem for me? Because lone pairs are larger than bonding pairs, lone pair-lone pair interactions are greater than lone pair-bonding pair interactions , which are in turn larger than bonding pair interactions. Using this notion, suggest how the following species would distort from regular geometries.\n\na. OF2\nb. SCl2\nc. PF3\n\nThank you. I just couldn't figure these ones out. Hello Catherine, Your question is a very good one.Now,in the first molecule OF 2, all the valence electrons are used up in bonding and it forms a stable molecule having linear geometry. In the second molecule SCL 2 the same is happening and the molecule is linear in geometry.But, in the last one that is PF 5, the three valence electrons of Phosphorus are used up in bonding with Fluorine electrons,leaving two  electrons of Phosphorus as Lone-pairs,as a  result the molecule has a distorted geometry and the molecule has a Pyramidral shape like that of NH 3. I think I can able to make you understand.Bye.

8	Is it crazy to look up a love you haven't seen in over 5 years? He contacted my grandparents a few months ago which was the last known number he had. but he didn't leave a way to get in contact with him, he was my first love, and my grandparents don't like him, so I can't ask them to give him my new number because they won't Go for it girl.......If he's calling your family, that means he wants to talk to you....He probably thought your grandparents wouldn't give you his number, that's probably the reason he didn't leave any! It isn't crazy at all, trust me that's perfectly natural...Follow your instincts, you'll never know unless you try...Life is about taking risks and about experimenting, how bad can it be? Go for it!
8	so confused? ok my bf is suppost to be coming out to see me (because we are in a long distance relationship), and the last time we talked was friday. he is on the road last time i talked to him, and it has been three days since we talked. i tried calling him to find out where he is but there is no answer. so my question is: am i overreacting? i am starting to worry that something has happened. No you are not over reacting.  Try contacting his parents or friends.  I hope everything is okay.  I will pray on it.

7	What is your favorite cartoon and tell me a little about it.? nick's as told by ginger. :D\n\ni love the show, because it portrays well the life of a typical teen- aged (or pre- teen) girl, who gets caught in your average everyday problems, like having popularity issues, an at- times- hostile *in* crowd, separated parents, annoying little brothers, love and relationships, friendships, among many other issues. it's about trying to fit in, and finding out who you really are and how those around you help you be that person you want to be.\n\n~~ As Told by Ginger is an American animated television series which debuted on Nickelodeon in October of 2000. Produced by Klasky Csupo Inc. (the creators of the Rugrats media franchise), and created by Emily Kapnek, the show revolves around the life of Ginger Foutley, a typical junior high school student who lives in a fictional Connecticut community named Sheltered Shrubs. The show is unique, in that many of the characters have actual wardrobes (to save time and money most cartoon characters are almost always drawn wearing the same outfit).\n\nCharacters\nGinger Foutley (Melissa Disney), the main character, talented poet (there are two episodes that deal with poems she's written) and diary keeper (she's often seen writing in it), \n\nDeidre Hortense "Dodie" Bishop (Aspen Miller) and Macie Lightfoot (Jackie Harris), Ginger's two slightly dorky best friends, \n\nCourtney Gripling (Liz Georges), their rich and arrogant classmate who has been hanging out with Ginger. Courtney completely disappeared during the high school episodes. \n\nMiranda Killgallen (Cree Summer), who has been doing things to keep Courtney and Ginger apart (in the very first episode, she even has her arrested for stealing, after she recommended Ginger to do so for Courtney's birthday party). \n\nCarl Foutley (Jeannie Elias) and Robert Joseph "Hoodsey" Bishop (Tress MacNeille), Ginger and Dodie's younger brothers respectively, who tend to do weird things that are, most of the time, a given episode's subplot (for example, running a lunch cart), \n\nBlake Gripling (Kath Soucie), Courtney's younger brother, who occasionally tags along with Carl and Hoodsey, \n\nLois Foutley (Laraine Newman), Ginger's divorced mother, who works as a late shift nurse at a local hospital, \n\nDarren Patterson (Kenny Blank), Ginger's next door neighbor, who later becomes her boyfriend. \n\nalso, i love hey! arnold. and spongebob squarepants, and anime like boys be, gto, gundam wing among MANY others

8	How do I get him to talk to me again? To make a long story short: I confronted this guy I have been talking to since February about some girl he has been talking to. The reason I did it is bc she already is attracted to him and when I asked him if he has ever talked to her he said "no". I found out Monday that he has talked to her and I asked him about it and he said yes. Another reason I am upset about the girl is because she was having sex with this guy I use to talk to...so of course I feel like she is competition and I don't want her to have someone I want.\n\nHe got so mad at me about it and I've tried to talk to him yesterday, but he just ignored me. What makes it worst is that I am not upset if I have to lose him, its the fact that I was going to go visit him next month and already have my plane ticket (he and I live in 2 separate states).\n\nWill he ever talk to me again? I was thinking that maybe if I just not try to contact or talk to him for the next 2 weeks, then maybe he will have calmed down and he'll stop hating me.\n\nI even sent him a message asking him if he was mad at me, are we no longer friends and if so to tell me so I could do something about my plane ticket....he just ignored me. \n\nhelp :( This is too complicated and convoluted to even care about. Just go do something productive and forget all of this crap.
2	Hurts to have sex? We had sex for the first time a long, long time ago. We have been doing it for about 7 or 8 months.\n\nThe problem is, I have only made her orgasm twice during sex, after tons of foreplay. I have absolutely no problem getting her to come from eating her out. She says it hurts every time, just like the first time did. For some reason, she didn't bleed the first time.\n\nI have heard the suggestion to try with her on top. It doesn't work - I can't get it in. I've only been able to get it in once, when I held it because she can't do it. It just slides. I gave up on that a long time ago, because when I did get it in once, she said it hurt way worse and that she couldn't have sex like that.\n\nI don't want to have sex with her if I'm going to hurt her.\n\nPlease help me out. Yes, she could possibly still have part of her hymen, particularly if she didn't bleed--either she didn't have one to begin with, or it didn't get stretched or torn enough.  \n\nHave you tried using lubricants?  That might help--there's a lot of friction down there, it could hurt without a good lube.    \n\nIs it possible that she's nervous...maybe worried that someone else will hear, worried about getting pregnant, anything.  If she's not relaxed, the muscles down there will tighten up and make things painful.\n\nThis is something she should ask her gynocologist about, if nothing seems to help.  Don't worry, gynocologists hear this sort of thing all the time.  They will be able to tell if there's a physiological problem.  \n\nSex is both a mental and a physical thing.  If she's worried, nervous, thinking about something else, has a hormonal problem, still has her hymen, doesn't have enough lubricant...all of those things and more can contribute to it.

9	Do you think same sex marriges should be legal? do you think it's natural,I don't I don't understand what people mean when they say it's not "natural."  Natural means something that exists in nature... homosexuality is naturally occuring, therefore it is natural.  Homosexuality is frequently seen among other primate species, not to mention that it has always been a part of human culture (whether openly or not).  What do you mean by not "natural?"  It happens in nature, therefore it can't be not natural.  I just don't get that argument.  \n\nI do think that same sex marriages should be legal, I don't think that there's a substantive difference between "unions" and "marriage"--it's not all in the name, there's nothing in the name but pointless bigotry, and haven't we already been through "separate but equal"?  And I don't get how legalizing same sex marriage would be the end of society.  Nobody has yet explained that to me, except to say that in Norway they have legalized gay marriage and more Norwegian kids are now born out of wedlock.  What the connection is there, I'm not sure, and why it's bad for kids to be born out of wedlock, I'm not sure either, as long as they have a loving home.

2	Is there a difference between a Dietitian and a Nutritionist? Dietitians are licensed, The term "nutritionist" does not always indicate licensure or specific qualifications. See below for more detail. \n\n"Dietitians" (the preferred spelling in the United States) make up the majority of nutrition counselors who see patients in hospitals, clinics or other medical settings. In order to become a "Registered Dietitian" (R.D.), a person is usually licensed by a state government after passing the Registration Examination for Dietitians. In order to qualify to take this examination, an aspiring dietitian needs to complete four years of college, including required coursework in food science, food safety, chemistry, biology, anatomy and several other course areas that are specified by the Commission on the Accreditation for Dietetics Education. They also need to complete 900 hours of apprentice work in a clinical setting. This clinical work can be built into a specially designed undergraduate program or can be completed separately, as an internship program in dietetics. With somewhat less training, a person can qualify for the title, "Dietetic Technician, Registered" (DTR).\n\nThe term "nutritionist" does not always indicate licensure or specific qualifications. Many dietitians casually call themselves "nutritionists," because they counsel people about nutrition. Some people use the term "nutritionist" to describe people who are educated in the field of dietetics or nutrition, but are not licensed to provide care to medical patients. There are many people who design food plans for communities or cafeterias who are not licensed as providers, but who provide an invaluable service by highlighting healthy eating practices in our communities.\n\nThank you for the question I learned something too.

4	is it possible to get dsl from another telephone company than the one you are with now? I have sprint but I want Yahoo SBC dsl is this possible and if not what are my options.Please! You absolutely can!  DSL is deregulated, meaning you can get your DSL service from any DSL provider in your area.  While some service providers have restrictions on their subscriptions (i.e. having to purchase your local phone service from them as well), it is ILLEGAL for your phone company to deny you DSL service from any other providers in your area, just like it is ILLEGAL for them to deny you local phone service from any other providers in your area.\n\nThere are several DSL providers nationwide (SBC, Verizon, Covad, PacBell (in California), etc.).\n\nA quick search of Yahoo gave the following:\n\nhttp://dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Business_to_Business/Communications_and_Networking/Broadband/Digital_Subscriber_Line__DSL_/\n\nHowever, your options as to whom provides DSL in your area may be limited.

0	How much did the Golden Shrine in Iraq cost that Mosque blew up? I don't know exactly how much in money. but of course millions, but it is by time and by people donations, government spendings and organizations fund.   In addition, shiite consider that place is sacred and holy.  it is for them like Mecca for whole Muslims and many sunnis also respect it.  but the hardline sunnis such as Wahabites and Qaeda, those consider shrines as places for worshiping bodies and not God as they claim.  Wahabites (those who dominate Saudi Arabia and Many Al-Qaeda Members)  has long history of attacking and targetting such places.  in last 200 years, they destroyed several shrines in Saudi Arabia.  they also once attacked Iraq cities when the whole region was under Turkish rule (Ottomans).  and They made attrocities, \n\nAlso, this shrine value alot historically, it is ancient, and renewed several times, at least 100 years old for the golden doom, and for the shrine hundreds of years.  the tomb s for men died almost before 900 years. \n\nMany people died because of such attack after that.  however, it is not first attack on a shrine, in the beginning after the war of 2003, Al-Qaeda assasinated one shiite leader by a huge explosion in Shrine in Najaf which damaged the shrine hardly and killed more than 100 prayers.  and several attempts done against another shrines.   in Iran, once also shrine in Mash-had attacked by such extremist, although Iran blamed the communist opposition.\n\nThe goal behind such attacks is to make civil war, and it is launched at least at first place by those foriengers, fanatic Islamists and Arabists who came across border to commit their plans in driving US out, so they can establish an Islamic empire that can conquer the world and spread Islam.

0	to muslims,you keep telling us? how great your allah is so what has he done for you except get you to kill inocent people,if thats your god you can keep him/her, i'll stick to my own thankyou, Jihadists today invoke the Qur’an to justify the worst terrorist crimes. Throat slitting of infidels is mentioned in the Qur’an. Al-Mawardi (d. 1058), the prominent 11th century jurist quoted this verse, specifically,  « When you encounter those who deny (the Truth) then strike (their) necks. » (Qur’an 47 :4), in his learned discussion of jihad. This ritual execution is also mentioned in other Muslim legal texts and in narratives of Christian and prominent Muslim historians. Today it is performed against infidels and recorded on videotape for the edification of Muslim audiences. \n\nWhen the average pious Muslim reads a verse like 2:132 (“And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob; ‘Oh my sons! Allah hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in the Faith of Islam’”) or 3:67 (“Abraham was not a Jew nor yet a Christian; but he was true in Faith, and bowed his will to Allah’ (which is Islam), and he joined not gods with Allah”), he understands what so many imams tell him: that the true Jews and Christians of today are the Muslims, and the people who go by those names are renegades and rebels against God. \n\nThis is of course nonsense.\n\nThis argument does not rest on any idea that Abraham or Moses observed specifically Islamic rituals, but on the idea that they were prophets of the True Faith which was restored by Mohammed after it was corrupted by Jews and Christians.\n\nThis is of course nonsense.
1	Is time travel possible? If time has no beginning and no end, wouldn't that make it a circle?  If it is a circle, wouldn't it be possible to come back around to the start? Time travel is completly possible. \n\nwhen Albert Einstein released his theory of special relativity, he laid the foundation for the theoretical possibility of time travel. As we all know, no one has successfully demonstrated time travel, but no one has been able to rule it out either. \n\nIf you travel at the speed of light, time stops for you, not for other people. So say you travel at the speed of ligt for a week in space, when you come back to earth youll find that its been maybe 100 years in the future.\n\nI also know a russian astronaught (<--- Spelling wrong) that traveled a fraction of a seconed in the future. This is because he was aboard the russian space station. If you travel fast enough for a long period of time its possible.\n\nThere is a scientist that is building this machine, its suppose to be able to send particles into the future or past i forgot, but when this person turns the time machine on, he could start getting messages from the future.\n\nBut yes time travel is possible.

4	in php, what is the difference with .= after $disp as opposed to just the equal sign? I mean \n$disp .=\n\nas opposed to\n$disp = PHP has a operator that allows the user to join two variables together. And that operator is a dot (.)\n\nSo if you have this: \n==============================\n<?php\n$disp = 'Hi ';\n$disp .= 'm0';\nprint $disp;\n?>\n==============\n\nThe above will print:\nHi m0\n\nWhen we say equal it is intializing that variable to that. like\n====\n$a = 1;\n$b = 2;\n====\nSo if I print out a it will be 1 or if I prinf out b it will be 2.\n\nIf I say:\n====\n$a = 1;\n$c = $a.'3';\nprint $c;\n====\nThat will print out  13\n\nYou could have other forms of operators such as:\n===\n$a =1;\n$a += 2;\n=== \na will print out 3 since (a += b) is the same as   a = a + b;\n\nThe correct word for it would be concatentation between variables, the other operators like - or + are only valid for numbers integers.\n\nGood luck on your quest.

(you will take some bad falls so start real small )\n          Hope that helped.
7	Who'd win in a fight, Jack Bauer or Chuck Norris? Oh good lord! Jack of course! Chuck would get all into some contorted sort of martial arts pose and then Jack would just up and shoot him in the leg and yell, "Tell me where the bomb's at!!!" To which a bloody and weepy Norris would reply, "What the H are you talking about?" But it wouldn't matter because Jack would have already snuck out of the building by posing as an FBI agent.

0	Count your blessings...? Name them one by one. I asked God for strength that I might achieve. I was made weak that I might learn humbly to obey. I asked for health that I might do greater things. I was given infirmity that I might do better things. I asked for riches that I might be happy. I was given poverty that I might be wise. I asked for power that I might have the praise of men. I was given weakness that I might feel the need of God. I asked for all things that I might enjoy life. I was given life that I might enjoy all things. I got nothing that I asked for, but everything I hoped for. Almost despite myself, my unspoken prayers were answered. I am, among all men, most richly BLESSED.
7	If you could become Paris Hilton, would you do it?  I mean think of all the shopping, parties, and luxuries? On the other hand, you'd have that monolithic NOSE to contend with, not to mention the orange skin, the bad hair, and the reputation of being a wench. NO WAY! She's an insult to women, a terrible role model for girls, and the perfect example of conspicuous consumption. Instead of partying and blowing money she should think about spending most of that cash on something that's meaningful.She probably has no trouble sleeping at night because she's a spoiled brat without a conscience, but I wouldn't be able to stand myself.

6	What are some good, inexpensive, investement ideas i could handle, any good mutual funds,stocks,bond,realeste? I'm looking for some not too expensive ways to increase my asset column.  Any suggestions on ways to have my money work for me? It really depends upon what your risk tolerance is and what your return expectations are of an investment.  Likewise, are you looking long term, medium or short term?\n\nOnehint is stay away from most stocks under $5 a share.  There's a reason why they're so cheap and generally it's not a good reason.  THat's not to say all cheap stocks are high risk but be sure to do your homework.  The combination of factorsd I personally look for are (a) consistent financial performance of the company in general and a consistent price graph for the stock; (b) a history of consistent dividend payments which I usually have reinvested as stock instead of taking the cash; (c) those companies which pay dividends, it's always nice to see periodic increases in dividend payouts or, alternatively, no decrease in dividend payouts; (d) if I can get all of that and there's a history of stock splits I'm usually chomping at the bit; and (e) we all need a little bit of luck combined with some basic research on the company's financial position, prior performance, cash position (to pay out those lovely dividends!).\n\nOne last thing - invest smart. One thing I tell those new to investing is only invest that amount which you are willing and ready to lose.  Not a doomsday approach but you don't want to have a bad taste in your mouth if the market goes "bad" on you and your investments take a hit.\n\nGood Luck!

0	Can you be persecuted if you don't really exist? Several writers have suggested that Christianity was not formed until several hundred years after Christ.  This notion has absolutely no basis in fact whatsoever.  If you want secular sources alone, fine, take Roman historians (such as Tacitus).  Nero persecuted/killed hundreds of CHRISTIANS around 64 AD.  Domitian did the same at the close of the 1st century.  How did they persecute a group that didn't exist? To whom are you referring? Do you have any citations? Jesus' followers during his lifetime and shortly after are considered Christians, and Christianity started out as a Jewish sect. I don't think this is in dispute by reputable religious scholars, so some citations from you would be helpful to get to the bottom of this. \n\nA timeline for Christianity can be found below.\n\nETA: Anyone who thinks Christianity started in the Garden of Eden is completely wacko. Do a little reading, please.

3	what are the three effects of power blackout on a major city or town? Remember a couple years ago when power went out all across the northeast? I will never forget the photograph of the pedestrians walking across the bridge in New York City. There was no public transportation; the subway was out.\n\nWe could not cook because we have just electric stove and microwave. No restaurants were open. All of the businesses had to close. Definitely a major loss of income that day. \n\nThere is always increased crime. It is dark; no one can see them and alarms systems likely do not work. Video cameras arent taping them. They can loot or do whatever they want.\n\nIf it is very cold then you have the elderly to be concerned about. They freeze without the heat. If it is very hot; same thing. They swelter without fans or air conditioning.
1	Can an asteroid ever break out of the asteroid belt and hit earth or any other planet??? Please State Reason. Asteroids are celestial bodies that orbit the Sun much like the planets do. The reason that they are defined by some other term is simply because they are much smaller in size (generally, thought not all are small in size and some are definitely larger than Pluto).\n\nAsteroids orbit the Sun in elliptical orbits and are present in the area between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some of the orbits cross the Earth and hence can collide against Earth.

1	How much will the time duration between the man's death and the dooms day(end of the earth and human kind) ? Dooms day- the end of the earth.. the human kind .(qayamat), . \nAccording to einstien it was one sec...\nWhat u people think ? Einstein comprehended that time is relative.  From the perspective of the living ... it would appear to be millions of years (or maybe not, given world events just now), but from a metaphysical point of view time is different.  It is not too difficult to understand that, relatively speaking, we could die and find ourselves at the Day of Judgement almost instantaneously.  If you're looking for an absolute truth on this question the answer is that nobody knows.

9	If there were no illegal aliens to provide cheap labor in the US what would happen to the economy? If the illegals were "sent packing," would the US economy be better or worse?  Without a cheap source of labor in the US,would more businesses simply move to foreign lands where the labor would be cheaper thus reducing jobs for Americans?  Are illegals doing only the jobs Americans won't do? Would there be more jobs for Americans and those immigrants who are here legally?  Would wages go up due to there being less competition for jobs and employers couldn't pay people "unofficially?"  Would wages go down as Americans and legal immigrants fight for fewer jobs as businesses close down because they would have to pay more or would move out of the country? Would there be more tax dollars available to fund programs for citizens or would there be fewer tax dollars due to fewer jobs in the economy? Opinions one way or the other? If illegals have the "cheap labor" jobs...then does it matter if they move overseas, because Americans don't have those jobs anyway....\nIllegals pay no taxes, do not contribute to society...just take advantage of the numerous social programs....our economy would improve...if there were no illegals...the places that hire them with no papers would be forced to hire Americans..who would demand better wages, and better working environments, which the illegals can't do because they would get caught.
5	¿what is the best soccer league of the world? Well, if its name be used, and any league qualifies, then I would say the champions league.\n\nit has the best of all the leagues across europe, all those champions fighting it out to see who will remain standing after the long group stage and then the pivotal knock out rounds.  Just look at the teams still in there (Arsenal, Barca, AC Milan) and you can see that, short of the World Cup and possibly the Euro competition, it is the showcase for players.

7	a good match? is sagittarrius a good match for aquarius There's no real reason for it, but as an Aquarius I've never found a Sagittariius man who I'd want to spend much time with. They seem to adapt some of the characteristics of the centaur that represents them. Macho to an extreme. If they're really smart, they can be interesting, but tend toward infidelity. \n\nEccentric, open-minded Aquarius may find a Sag too traditional in philosophy as well. Let me also say, I don't recall any Sag falling for me either. I don't think they like independent women.\n\nHowever, there may other things in your horoscopes which soften and undo many of negatives I've mentioned. And since they are 60 degrees apart in zodiac, that is supposed to bode for a good relationship.
2	can somebody tell me how can i lose fats from my belly and change it into muscles, or abs? Ofcourse you can't change fat into muscle, you need to lose the fat first. I'm not sure if there are any diets where you lose fat from your belly first except Jorge Cruise's 3-hour diet, because with that diet you eat every 3 hours which keeps your metablolism revved up. I quote Cruise, " In the New England journal of medicine, they published a study. In the study they specifically showed that eating every three hours reduced the stress hormone called cortisol. That's why belly fat goes down -- the reduction in cortisol. When you have high levels of this cortisol hormone, it's closely associated to abdominal fat. In this study it was shown that in as little as two weeks, individuals who ate frequent small meals, as opposed to three large meals, containing the same amount of calories, just breaking them down over time, over six meals versus three, they were able to reduce cortisol levels by more than 17%. That was just in the first two weeks -- it was wonderful. When you do this long term, the body gets efficient at staying low in cortisol level and that's what you want. That the how you stay slim and trim; with belly fat especially, it's all about removing the stress hormone cortisol. "\nCheck out the diet.. its actually very easy because you're never hungrey and you don't eliminate any kind of food.\n\nAfter you lose the fat fom your belly, you need to start doin excercises that target the belly area and thus build muscle.\nGood luck!

I think it depends on what you mean by "successful".\n\nYou could also narrow the choice to certain industries.\n\nSome would say the consulting firm that makes the most money, but I would counter the most successful firm is the one with the most long-term customers.  If you are keeping customers - no matter what the field - then you are successful.\n\nMike Honeycutt

9	What does "an arrogant, elitist, left wing agenda" mean.? This phrase was used in an article about the New York Times publishing news about terrorist financing.  I'm not up on political jargon, It means that the editor of the Times showed his arrogance by ignoring the laws of the land.  He published information during a time of war that will aid enemies of this country.\n\nHe is an elitist as he believes that the press is above the law and can do whatever they want, regardless of the implications on us.\n\nThe left wing agenda is the propensity for this type of thing to happen again and again, led by the left-wing media of this country.

8	guys....what do u notice? what do you notice in a girl? I always notice the way a woman conducts herself from the first step. The way she moves her feet and the hips, if the shoulders stay parallel or do the slump and sway, where she has her hands when she is walking towards you, is her lips smiling as if she likes you or are they over exaggerated and she wants something from you, eye contact is probably the most important. when she first says anything to you if the eye contact stays during that first conversation, normally she speaks truth and that's a good start. \nHer style of clothes, the make up she wears and her physical condition tells you how in control of herself she is. \nOnce all of that is annualized, then its the sensuality. \nI saw a woman just today that everything about her said sexy ... Except for her eyes. I soon learned she had a small problem with her car and needed someone to help her. The eyes will always give it away.

1	How many years elapse between low points on sunpots? Purely in terms of numbers, sunspots vary with a cycle that is about 11yrs on average, known as the Schwabe cycle. One can't be any more precise than "about 11yrs" as the cycle varies somewhat, primarily due to fluctuations in the magnetic field of the sun. A more "geeky" answer is 22yrs, however (the Hale cycle), as the magnetic field of the sun reverses polarity each Schwabe cycle and so it takes 22yrs to "get back to where we started". This makes no difference to mere humans, as sunspots look the same to us in each phase, but if you were Superman with super-vision perhaps it would!

8	I could use some help? Me and my best friend like this same guy. We dont right over him. But i am afraid that one day we will. He is an 11th grader. His house burnt down. And we have been giving him money. And he gives us a hug when we give him money. Well i gave him some money thursday and he hugged me. When i told my best friend she seemed to be mad and a little upset. I feel like we are in a competition on who can give the most money to this guy as well. What do i do? First off, I think it is great you are trying to help him out. Second, this may not be a good time for him right now having two girls fight over him...His house just burned down. Approach him first...maybe say, "I was wondering if you wanted to go to a movie or something." Or, "would you like to come over to dinner." Don't flirt with him too much because it might scare him away. As for your best friend, if you two fight over the same guy, and quit being friends over it, then you probably don't need to be friends. But think about this: What if doesn't like either one of you, but just as friends?? It would be pretty stupid to lose your best friend over. Say you and this guy go to a movie together and things develop and your friend gets jealous over that, the she really doesn't need to be your friend. Friends shouldn't be jealous of each other...especially over a guy. Good luck, and follow your heart to make the right decisions.
1	If Photons are particles of light, then why is their energy described in terms of frequency? If you are to model Light in terms of waves, then, sure it will have its wavelength and frequency, but if u were to model it in terms of particles, then as we know, massless particles do not have wavelengths/frequencies (no De broglie wavelength because there is no mass involved). So how come when finding the enerygy of a particular photon, the equation that we use involves frequency of light? Photons are evil.\n\nRemember how scientists were able to slow down light to 17m/s? If photons were massless, they wouldn't slow down becasue they wouldn't need energy to move in the first place can any amount of energy would propel them at the speed of light.\n\nSo does it mean that photons have very little mass? If so, wouldn't they increase in mass when travelling at the speed of light when energy is converted into mass? \n\nTherefore, photons may have other properties no apparent in the 4 dimensions we live in and have other undiscovered properties in other dimensions.\n\nPhotons are indeed evil...

3	i want to know wath is the diffusion coating whit slurry process means? i have to find informaision about slurry process in case hardening in metallorgy plese help me!! A slurry is a mixture, which comes in different varieties:\n\nMetal Slurry can be used in pipe fitting and other welding tasks, as well as slurry based bombs like the BLU-82. \nIn farming—perhaps the most well-known use—farm slurry is a mixture composed chiefly of water and animal sewage. It has a distinct odour, noticeable when the substance is carried in tankers, or spread over fields. Misapplication of farm slurry can lead to environmentally damaging emissions of ammonia and other chemicals. See fertilizer. \nA liquid mixture (especially involving water) composed of a mixture of various insoluble matter, such as mud or plaster of paris. \nA special kind of slurry consisting of approximately 1% pulp (wood fiber) and 99% water, used to make paper, is called stock in the papermaking industry. \nSlurry pipelines are a specialized method of material transport that use a watery slurry to move particulates from location to another. \nIn wildland firefighting, slurry is a term used for the fire retardant dropped on a forest fire from an aircraft. "Slurry bomber" is a colloquial term for those aircraft. See aerial firefighting. \nIn cooking, particularly in restaurant kitchens, slurry refers to a mixture of a thickening agent (often cornstarch) and water, as a means of dispersing the thickener into hot sauces and soups near the end of the cooking process without forming lumps. Slurry can also refer to the mixture of coffee grounds and water in some kinds of brewing processes, such as a french press. \nMeat slurry is a product made from meats, making them more readily transportable, as well as removing fats, pigmentation and myoglobin. \nIn mining, slurry is a sort of liquid waste material that's stored elsewhere.

1	who was peter medawar? Sir Peter B. Medawar, OM, FRS (1915--1987). British immunologist of Arab extraction (which, as he said in Memoir of a Thinking Radish, makes him sound like a kind of gum). Won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1960 for work on tissue transplantation which eventually helped make organ transplants possible. In addition, he wrote extensively, and extremely well, on science and philosophy. \n\nPeter Brian Medawar was born on February 28, 1915, in Rio de Janeiro. He is the son of a business man who is a naturalized British subject, born in the Lebanon.\n\nMedawar was educated at Marlborough College, England, where he went in 1928. Leaving this College in 1932, he went to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study zoology under Professor J. Z. Young. After taking his bachelor's degree at Oxford, Medawar worked for a time at Sir Howard Florey's School of Pathology at Oxford and there became interested in research in fields of biology that are related to medicine.\n\nIn 1935 he was appointed Christopher Welch Scholar and Senior Demonstrator at Magdalen College, Oxford, and in 1938 he became, by examination, a Fellow of Magdalen College. In 1942 he was Rolleston Prizeman and in 1944 he became Senior Research Fellow of St John's College, Oxford, and University Demonstrator in zoology and comparative anatomy. In 1946 he was elected a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and in 1947 he was appointed Mason Professor of Zoology at the University of Birmingham. In 1951 he moved to London as Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College, London. Here he remained until 1962, when he was appointed Director of the National Institute for Medical Research, London.\n\nMedawar's earlier research, done at Oxford, was on tissue culture, the regeneration of peripheral nerves and the mathematical analysis of the changes of shape of organisms that occur during this development. During the early stages of the Second World War he was asked by the Medical Research Council to investigate why it is that skin taken from one human being will not form a permanent graft on the skin of another person, and this work enabled him to establish theorems of transplantation immunity which formed the basis of his further work on this subject. When he moved to Birmingham in 1947 he continued to work on it, in collaboration with R. Billingham, and together they studied there problems of pigmentation and skin grafting in cattle, and the use of skin grafting to distinguish between monozygotic and dizygotic twins in cattle. In this work they took into consideration the work of R. D. Owen and concluded that the phenomenon that they called «actively acquired tolerance» of homografts could be artificially reproduced. For this earlier work on transplantation and growth, Medawar was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, London. When he moved to London in 1951, Medawar continued to work with R. Billingham and L. Brent, on this phenomenon of tolerance, and his detailed analysis of it occupied him for several years. He also carried out other researches into transplantation immunity.\n\nThe Royal Society of London, where he was the Croonian Lecturer in 1958, awarded him the Royal Medal in 1959. In the same year, he was Reith Lecturer for the British Broadcasting Corporation. He has been elected a Foreign Member of the New York Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.\n\nIn 1937 Medawar married Jean Shinglewood Taylor, daughter of a Cambridge physician. They have two sons, Charles and Alexander, and two daughters, Caroline and Louise.\n\nFrom Nobel Lectures, Physiology or Medicine 1942-1962, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1964 \n\nThis autobiography/biography was written at the time of the award and later published in the book series Les Prix Nobel/Nobel Lectures.

1	Why does the suspended particles in a moving bus swings forward even if the bus is running against the windf? Usually, when we move in a vehicle, the wind flows towards our face. But why suspended particles in a bus also moves forward instead of flowing backward? Well, the wind is not a strong enough force to go against the force of motion that propells things forward. And thats if there was any wind getting into the bus, but it has four sides including a windsheild so I don't see how thats possible.
0	The Zabubaboolians have rejected me, Bafuudo, their mighty Squiggry.  Will you accept me? I had chosen the Zabubaboolians to be my special people.  I had given them a holy hatred of wasps, and only ask that they eat a little peanut butter each day.  But they have since "ousted" me, saying I'm not "cool" enough to be their "god."\n\nWell, I am the coolest of all Squiggries and Migglies, and I must now counter the Zabubaboolians, as they have rejected me!  Join me, be my people.  I will instill in you the holy hatred of wasps and give you the gift of peanut butter.\n\nAs my people, I will protect you against wasps and we will conquer the Zabubaboolians! Yes, let us destroy those wretched wasps; and indulge in the pleasure of peanut butter.\n\nCrispy or smooth?
4	when i see open ports on my network, how do i establish a connection to them? It all really depends on what type of application has the port open.  For instance, if you are running a web server you would most likely see port 80 and perhaps 443 for a secure web site. If you had an FTP server running, you would see port 21 open.  To gain access to these various ports, it is best to use the application intended (ie. Web browser, FTP client, etc.) If you want to make a raw connection to an open port you can sometimes uses the telnet protocol and add the port number to the end.  Drop to DOS and type 'telnet <ip# of computer w/open port> <port#>' like this:  'telnet 127.0.0.1 25'  This would connect you to a SMPT server running on your local computer (port# 25).
4	When I try to open video files on my movie maker, they don't show up and it says they're not the right kind. Windows Movie Maker prefers .WMV and DV-AVI files.  If you try to import other types you might get an error, or they might import and not work.  In these cases it is best to convert the files.  One choice is 'Windows Media Encoder' a free download from Microsoft.  It will convert many file types to WMV.\n\nAgain it depends on the file type, so if you need specifics on how to import a file, determine the file type and then go to www.papajohn.org > Import Movie Source Files > Video and look for the file extension.\n\nOr if you need more help, post the exact file type and the errors you are getting on the WindowsMovieMakers.net forums.

3	Did you ever know punctuation could be such fun? Quoting from "Eats, Shoots and Leaves" by Lynne Truss:  "Assuming a sentence rises into the air with the initial capital letter and lands with a soft-ish bump at the full stop, the humble comma can keep the sentence aloft all right, like this, UP, for hours if necessary, UP, like this, UP, sort-of bouncing, and then falling down, and then UP it goes again, assuming you have enough additional things to say, although in the end you may run out of ideas and then you have to roll along the ground with no commas at all until some sort of surface resistance takes over and you run out of steam anyway and then eventually with the help of three dots ... you stop." Hey, auntb.  My grammar students last semester thought it was hilarious that I got so excited about grammar.  I think this example is really cute, but do you think it would really help someone who didn't know how to use commas?

2	I have a question about brown bread? Ok, so everyone says brown bread is good for you, its healthy for your heart....so why does it have so many calories in it?? Brown bread is made from flour with out any of the outer casing of the wheat/barley/oats grains scrubbed off.  that is what makes it tan colored.  SOME brown bread is made with molasses and regualr white flour to fool us.  NOT FOOLED.  read the labels to see if it says "Whole grain wheat flour"\nThe calories are not bad for you.  All food has calories.  You need calories to burn to stay alive.  What is healthy about brown bread, the good kind, is that those little husky bits in the flour are nourishing and good for your intestinal tract.  Help you stay 'regular' if you get my meaning.  The whiteness of white  bread is achieved by removing all those husky bits of the wheat grain and then, perish the thought, they use clorox stuff to make it white and it will never rot!!  You eat the clorox too and therefore unbleached flour is better and healthier to eat.
4	hi every one , has anyone heard that "via raid tools" is a virus ? The Via Raid Tool is a RAID controller for a Via chipset in your motherboard. RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) is a method of taking multiple physical hard drives and making them function as a single logical volume (ie, you can have 2x 250gig hard drives, and the operating system you're using will see them as 1x 500 gig drive.) Raid also allows things like mirroring (where the 2x 250gig drives look like a single 250 gig drive), with any individual piece of data copied, or "mirrored" to both drives. This allows you to have 2 copies of every bit of stored data in case of a drive failure, if you have such critical data. There's also a function called "striping," where data is split evenly across drives to increase performance. \n\nThere's a bunch of other odds and ends, with parity and without, and some bits like Striping + Mirroring, and the like. \n\nThat's basically a very rough overview of RAID. As a general rule, if you didn't know what RAID is, likely you don't particularly need it. Most likely it can be safely removed, unless your system came preconfigured for RAID, which is a bit unlikely.

4	Describe a Web services application.? Describe a Web services application for monitoring the clarity of water of lakes in Minnesota. The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has placed a wireless sensor under the water in the middle of each lake that measures the clarity every minute and reports a single number indicating water clarity. The sensors have wireless network connections and each run a Web server that reports \nthe result as a simple HTML page. The sensor has limited power, so you want its Web server to only be touched once per minute. Your Web service runs on a computer on the shore of each lake. It scrapes the screen of the sensor Web site, and presents the results as a Web service. We want a main DNR Web site to have a display of the clarity of water in all of the lakes in the state. \n\nDraw an architecture of the entire system, including the \nsensors and the final Web site. Explain how it works. \n\nWhat are the practical and philosophical differences between \nhaving the sensor run a Web server and a web service directly Technically a web server is a web service - of sorts.  It responds to HTTP requests, typically with HTML documents.  However, the documents do not adhere to the SOAP standards implemented by most newer web services so the only recourse is to hunt the HTML for keywords and tags that indicate where the data you're scraping for is located.\n\nSince you have some practical limitations on how frequently these devices could be called, my first inclination would be to develop a centralized "collection" service that periodically polled the various clarity monitoring devices and stored the data in a local database (timestamped from an accurate, central time source).  It would still do the "scraping" from the various devices, but would act as a proxy to minimize the amount of traffic each device was required to handle.  The polling interval would be based upon how frequently you needed to update the data.\n\nI'm assuming these devices can be accessed via TCP/IP.  Lacking any drawing tools, the architecture is fairly simple.  \n\n[Polling Server] -- [Clarity Monitoring Devices]\n    |\n    |\n[Database Server]\n    |\n    |\n[Web Service]\n    |\n    |\n[Clients] or [Web Server]\n\nWhat would help is if you have the ability to modify the web page on the monitoring devices.  If so you could customize the HTML response to conform to a standard SOAP document that could be called as a remote object from the polling server (instead of having to parse the HTML).  Alternatively, you may also be able to have the web server on the monitoring devices respond in an XML format that can be much more easily parsed by the Polling Server.  I am assuming this is possible since the web server on these devices provides clarity information on-demand (which typically requires some sort of scripting).\n\nIf you would like additional details, please e-mail me at melancholygiant@yahoo.com.
2	how do i reduce my weight? Try walking, running, moving in general for a half an hour a day. Don't let up. Pep talks always help me. Don't eat when you're not hungry and drink plenty of water.

But if you deny yourself a candy bar or something like that, you're more likely to cheat on your diet and/or binge eat.

0	Isn't RELIGION like Star Wars? Ok, I made the comment to a preacher, "I think the Bible is a beautiful Novel with some really good poetry" and he replied.  "The bible is real written about real events.  How could someone just make something up, as complex as the bible?"  And I replied\nHow could someone make up Star Wars, which is way more complex and has way more "BOOKS" than the bible and alot less loopholes. Exluding laser guns and light sabers of course.LOL\nWhat's so bad about the possibility that the Bible is a NOVEL? Thing is, the Bible doesn't claim to be a novel.  It doesn't label itself with a fiction stamp.  Its many human authors (though God wrote through them) all claim it to be the inspired word of God Himself, the ultimate truth handed down to the human race containing what we need to know of who we are, what our purpose is, who God is, how we reach Him, and how we find value and meaning, not just in this life, but for eternity.  \n\nThere are 66 books in the Bible, last I heard, Star Wars was up to like 6 or 7 movies :)  The Bible has been espoused as reliable by the founding fathers of science like Newton, Galileo, and Pasteur.  Famous presidents and even Napoleon have spoken of the Bible's reliability and Jesus' divinity.  The Bible has more bibliographical backing then any other historical document in history, just read Josh McDowell's "More Then a Carpenter" where he applies the 3 tests applied to historical documents to the Bible.  There are hundreds of credible prophecies[1] which even Israelite scholars like Edersheim who deny Jesus as the Messiah, acknowledge as Messianic, and which fit Jesus to a "t".  There are numerous, numerous archeological finds[2] supporting the Bible.  There are thousands who have died for the name of Jesus Christ and thousands more who risk death daily around the world for His sake[3].  The apostles and many Christians since like the anabaptists have died peacefully, loving and forgiving their enemies, even as Jesus did.  \n\nUnlike the Koran or Vedas, the Bible's authors tell of their mistakes.  David tells of his sins with Bathsheba and how God punished him.  Moses tells of his breaking of a Messianic prophecy and how he couldn't enter the promised land because of it.  Job ends his book repenting of speaking of things he shouldn't have, as he says "I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes."[4]  Isaiah admits himself a "sinful man" and is frightened when meeting God, for he is unworthy[5]. Paul calls himself the "chief of sinners" and says he doesn't even deserve to be an apostle because he persecuted the church, while thanking God for His abundant grace and mercy[6].  What you should be realizing is that this is not human nature, to so freely admit our mistakes and say we don't deserve God's mercy.  It's not our nature to humble ourselves.  Not only does this very consistent practice through the Bible suggest authorship divine, for the human authors exalt God while abasing themselves, but also suggests that rather then seeking to exalt themselves, as in the Koran, they are intent first and foremost on telling the truth, including the undesirable truths about themselves.
8	Women, women, women? I find myself torn between two paths here, one alone and one with her. But I am waiting for HER to choose.

BUT in the same breath, I want to tell her she's being a selfish *****, that her indecision is breeding contempt and resentment in me for her, and that she ought to think twice before she assumes any guy as nice, as caring, as into her as I am is going to come around and WAIT for her to make up her ******* mind, she really is CRAZY!

0	what is the anthem of the u.s? just please tell me the answer dont tell me the details O say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light,\nWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming,\nWhose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,\nO’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?\nAnd the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,\nGave proof through the night that our flag was still there;\nO say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\n\nOn the shore, dimly seen thro’ the mist of the deep,\nWhere the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,\nWhat is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep.\nAs it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?\nNow it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,\nIn full glory reflected, now shines on the stream\n’Tis the star-spangled banner. Oh! long may it wave\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!\n\nAnd where is that band who so vauntingly swore\nThat the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion\nA home and a country should leave us no more?\nTheir blood has washed out their foul footstep’s pollution.\nNo refuge could save the hireling and slave\nFrom the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave,\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n\nOh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand\nBetween their loved homes and the war’s desolation,\nBlest with vict’ry and peace, may the Heav’n-rescued land\nPraise the Pow’r that hath made and preserved us a nation!\nThen conquer we must, when our cause it is just,\nAnd this be our motto—“In God is our trust.”\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

0	if everyone abandoned monotheism, would there be less war? No.\n\nHumans war because humans are violent, competetive creatures. They fight each other DESPITE religion, not BECAUSE of it. If they DO fight "because" of their religion, this is just one of the many things people fight over, and in its absence they probably would've found something else to fight over.\n\nSome hard evidence for you is that there are and have been many societies that are NOT monotheistic, but war frequently. One example is feudal Japan, which was in a state of constant warfare for centuries before any monotheistic religion was introduced. We're talking serious, constant warfare between "nobles" in which great armies of men died, and this went on for centuries. Ancient Greece/Rome also warred without any monotheism in their culture. We also see tribal warfare among tribes who worship multiple spirits/gods. There are many other examples- these are only a few.
3	why did Iocaste give up her child so easily in Oedipus Rex??? why did she not try harder to save her child(ie, maternal instinct)? why did she immediately leave her child to die, instead of trying to stop the oracle in some other way, or see if it even happens? my only guess is that teh greek gods were thought so highly of that she gave up Oedipus becasue of her trust in the gods and to protect the family name... got anything better?? also, where exactly is the reversal of the situation in Oedipus Rex, aka Oedipus the King, aka Oedipus Tyrannus. Since the founding of religion, the gods have sought to test those with power. Jocasta was sent by Apollo to do just that: to test Oedipus' faith and conviction. \n\nThroughout the play, Jocasta tested the beliefs of those around her by feigning disbelief in the gods herself. Though she put up this false front, she did keep her faith. At the beginning of the scene wherein a messenger relayed word of Polybus' death and Oedipus' ascension to the throne of Corinth, we see Jocasta praying - not the act of a disbeliever at all! Again, in the same Episode, Jocasta carries garlands and incense to the altar and tries to appeal to Apollo to purify the city of Thebes. \n\nWhile her faith remains strong, her task from the gods is to test the faiths of others, especially that of Oedipus, which she does. After accusing Creon of conspiracy and treason, Oedipus relates to Jocasta the details of his meeting with Tiresius. Jocasta proceeds to plant doubts of the gods by telling Oedipus the story of the Delphian Oracle and the circumstances surrounding Laius' death. Again, after Polybus' death, she excitedly tells Oedipus that his prophecy was obviously untrue, though it wasn't, and by doing so she attempts to hint that the oracles - and thus the gods - are false. By planting this doubt in Oedipus' mind, the gods are able to test his faith, and his ruling power, through Jocasta - a test which he fails until it is too late. \n\nWhy, then, would Jocasta be forced to perform such a dubious task for the gods? It is because she tried to avoid an earlier prophecy. By tying her child's feet together and casting him out, she attempted to defeat the gods, and this of course angered them. Her punishment, then, was to test the beliefs of the very child she cast out. \n\nOedipus Rex was Sophocles' attempt to show the Greeks that they could not avoid the dealings of the gods, or they may be forced to conspire against the very people they should love most. Jocasta was, in this way, a victim. Though it was by her own doing that this penalty was cast upon her, it was not something she was happy to do, which becomes apparent when she realizes the truth in her earlier prophecy. It is at this moment that she becomes aware of her punishment, and in desperation kills herself. Oedipus Rex is a true tragedy in the sense that fate and Oedipus' own tragic flaw (his hotheadedness) combine to bring about his downfall. What makes it that much more tragic, however, is that the events were, for the most part, out of Oedipus' control. The chain of events was set in motion by his own mother. He was forced to leave Corinth (thus trying to avoid his own prophecy), afraid he may bring harm to the persons whom he loved the most. Scared and angry at the curse he carried upon his back, who can blame him for being hot tempered? It is Jocasta, his own mother and wife, that brings the story full circle by again cursing him, perpetuating a disbelief in the gods. \n\nJocasta is a victim in Oedipus Rex, but not as much as she is a catalyst for Oedipus' own victimization. She keeps her faith throughout and tries to relieve Oedipus of his. Because of this, readers may in turn pity her and loathe her. But the gods tested the king of Thebes through her - the main goal of the play - and both he and she failed. \n\nShe is purely a victim.  She was sent to do a job and like previous paragraphs. Failed.  Her faith was in the Gods.  If she had more in herself then she would have saved her children.  They relied more on their faith in the Gods then in themselves.  I would think now that if someone did this they would be crazy.  Why give up your flesh and blood for a higher power.  I couldn't, could you?\nI didn't understand your last question in your paragraph. Care to elaberate?

1	I captured a shrew in my house today.  We seem to have these creatures every few years. Has anyone else? Shrews eat their weight in insects every day so are not completely bad.  But they multiply like mice and their bite has a mild venom, so I don't want them around my grandbabies. Has anyone else had shrews in their house? If so, what did you do about them? I don't think  the shrews are going to bite your grandchildren unless they are catching the shrews and handling them.  They would probably not be able to catch one.  When was the last time you were bit by a mouse in your house!  They are not going to attack or anything...they are going to try to avoid you and much as you would like to avoid them.  Try to find where they are getting in and block the entrance. Put out Sherman live trap, this trap does not kill them, catches them so you can relocate them far from your home.\n\nhttp://www.shermantraps.com/

3	Whats the difference between a diploma, associate, bachelor, and all the other degrees? A diploma indicates completion of high school course work.\n\nAn associate's degree indicates completion of a 2-year (usually technical) degree, most likely at a community college.\n\nA bachelor's degree indicates completion of a 4-year college/university coursework. \n\nA master's degree is earned after the bachelor's, and can last anywhere from 1-3 years depending on the school and major. You can either study what you studied as an undergrad, or choose a new area to study for a master's.\n\nPhD and Doctoral degrees are the advanced degrees earned by doctors, lawyers, and other high-ranking professionals. These advanced programs are tailored directly to the field they plan to work in.
2	Recently I had a tubal litigation done and it was suppose to only be about an inch incision and this Dr. has? 35yrs of x-perience.  When he went to cut the spot he hit a main blood vessel artery. He also had a camera tool to use so that it shows him what's inside and so forth.  So now instead of having an one ince scar I have a scar that will go all the way down to my pelvic line.  I'm still recovering from it and it looks awful.  My belly button doesn't even look a belly button anymore and I have a lot of pain on the outsides and inside.  My question is should I sue for medical malpractice because he quote "made a mistake and unfortunately I was the one"?  He's an excellent Dr. and we live in a small community and I don't want to tarnish his name but I don't feel that this should of happened.  If I do sue, is there any chance of keeping it silent so that the whole community doesn't know?  Thanks. The best thing would be to talk to a lawyer.All Doctors have malpractice insurance and it could be done without causing a huge fuss.

5	how to build a suppresor? Supressors or silencers, are LEGAL in many areas of the US today (arizona, being one).\nConstruction can be rather simple.  The lengthy answer posted above describes what one is, but does little to help you build one.\ndepending on the power of your cartridge, you should attempt to have an outer tube of roughly 3 times the outer diameter of the barrell of the gun.\nwashers drilled to .05 inch larger than the bullet  (THIS must be precisely centered) welded to either end.  Internally you may use several methods\n1. the close stacked method.  This uses a series of hard and soft spacers, typically made of steel washers and 3M green scrubbing pad-type material (the kind used for scouring pots and pads) packed alternating materials until the tube is full.\na nut is centered and welded onto one of the end washers.\nThis is a heavy and not completely silent supressor, but it is cheap and easy to build\nthe second type follows current auto and motorcycle muffler design.\nagain starting with an outer tube and end washers correctly drilled.\ninside there is a steel screen or perforated sheet of steel rolled in a diameter slightly larger than the bullet, so as not to contact the bullet.  the space between the screen and the outer tube is stuffed with either fiberglass or steel wool.  If using steel wool, it is recommended to use various grades to help absorb a wider range of frequencies.\nThis type of supressor is musch lighter and efficient and lasts a VERY long time.  the drawback is that it takes a much more skilled hand to fabricate.\n\nENJOY!

1	how does a venturi pump work? To produce vacuum, a venturi pump uses a transducer, which forces compressed air through a small opening into a venturi section. As air exits the opening, it expands, increasing in speed to supersonic velocity before entering the venturi section. This creates vacuum, or negative pressure, at the vacuum inlet port which is located between the opening and the venturi section.

2	I want to try viagra..? I know I have to go to a doctor first..  I was wondering if anyone had a good thing to tell my doctor so that he would write me a perscription. (Don't say..the truth, and yes, I am in good physical condition and not that old!) well you can go down to Tiajuana and buy pills there for like $7 a pill if you want to try...or talk to your doctor and ask for a sample pack the drug reps usually always leave sample packs at their offices. However....If you don't have a problem in that area then i would steer clear of those types of medications....what they do is increase the bloodflow to the vascular tisue of the penis. increasing the bloodflow for someone who doesn't have blood flow issues can possible stretch out the blood vessles in the penis, permanently damaging it...then the bloodflow that you usually had won't cause the penis to become errect and you'll be unable to maintain an erection without the aid of viagra...hence fowarth becomming dependant on it to fill the larger blood vessles. can also cause pyrines disease which is a curvature of the penis causes by stretching and scaring of the blood vessles in the penis.....just be careful bro.
4	USB external drive causes Windows XP Home to freeze? I have a 200GB Western Digital HD with a USB-to-IDE external enclosure. Everytime when I plug the USB cable into to my Toshiba L25-S119 notebook computer, the Windows XP Home hang/freeze. The following are some information about my computer hardware, OS, and HD:\n\nComputer maker and model: Toshiba Satellite L25-S119\nHardware information (general):\nCPU: Intel Celeron M 370 (1.5GHz) 1MB L2, 400MHz FSB\nRAM: 768MB (256 + 512) PC4200 DDR2 533MHz SDRAM 1.8V SODIMM\nChipset: ATI RADEON XPRESS 200M Chipset\nSouthbridge: ATI SB400\nInternal HD: 60GB FUJITSU MHV2060AH, 5400RPM, EIDE (ATA-6)\nOptical drive: MATS.H.I.TA DVD/CDRW UJDA770\n\nOS and BIOS information:\nOS: Windows XP Home with SP2\nBIOS: Toshiba v1.80 (12/14/05)\n\nExternal USB HD: Western Digital 200GB HD (IDE)in NTFS with 2 partitions. (approximately 150 + 50 GB)\n\nExternal Enclosure: Metal Gear Box with AC-to-DC power supply.\n\n\nOther information:\n\nThe external USB HD works fine with my another two desktop PCs: Windows XP Pro SP2 and Windows 98 SE (with NTFS for Win98 and USB driver). And, it also works perfectly with my friends' Sony and HP notebook computers (Win xp Home).\n\nMy first thought was a driver problem. However, I checked the drivers it installed in this notebook were same as my other PCs. \n\nI tried Windows XP Pro SP2 clean installation on this computer, but the problem still occured. Therefore, it is not some problems with the Home edition of Windows XP.\n\nThe external enclosure has a DC power supply, so power won't be the problem.\n\nI have tried all my three USB ports. All the three USB ports works fine with my SanDisk 1GB Flash drive.\n\nI did a CHKDSK using my desktop PC, and the disk was fine.\n\nI also uninstalled and reinstalled all the USB and disk drivers, but it still the same.(set DEVMGR_SHOW_NONPRESENT_DEVICES=1 devmgmt.msc)\n\nThe only situation that it works with this computer is when I boot the computer from Knoppix Linux CD. So, I guess this is not a hardware problem. How do you guys think? Thanks in advance. I discovered a configuration mismatch\nCPU: Intel Celeron M 370 (1.5GHz) 1MB L2, 400MHz FSB\nRAM: 768MB (256 + 512) PC4200 DDR2 533MHz \n\nThe clock frequency of the RAM may not be higher than the clock frequency of the FSB. Every manufacturer of a mainboard with FSB 400MHz would recommend RAM of the types PC2100 or PC2700.\nThis might not be the reason for your hangs/freezes, but the timing of PC4200 DDR RAMs on a 400MHz FSB is critical anyway.

Travel and adventures come to you no matter what service you join its what MOS you want is more important. Medic is a good field, linguest is also a good field but you will find more adventure in Medic or Military Police. It want you want in a future. When you are a linguest you can work at Embassies or in security fields offices. The choice is yours because its your future
9	Who was the commanding officer of the defending army during the battle of New Orleans? Also, how many casualties did the defenders suffer? Andrew Jackson. It was a total massacre! The british were slaughtered. I don't know how many brits were killed but it was in the thousands. But only 13 americans died fighting the strongest military in the world, at the time. That was actually the last battle ever fought with Britain...

9	claim of prescriptive easement on 2 feet strip of property of neighbor where a fence has been for over 50,year neighbor wants us to move fence. what options do we have to keep it where it is and has been for over 50 years It sounds like you have acquired adverse posession of the land, but the exact requirements of that vary by state. If you believe you have adverse posession, file a "quiet title" action in court to quiet all other claims to the land. You should probably speak to a real estate lawyer.

5	What are some tips on tackle football? It's hard to give you any specific tips without knowing what position you will be trying out for. But for starters, always keep you head up. Keep your feet moving constantly. You should practice getting into the stance of the position you want to play, such as two point stance or three point stance. \nIf you are thinking about being a ball carrier you should focus on sprinting. When running the football you need to be explosive. Stay low and keep you legs churning. You may also want to get a good feel for the ball. You can do this by buying the same size football you would be playing with and take it with you wherever you go.\nIf you are lineman material you want to work on exploding out of your three point stance. You need to be able to fire out low. I teach my linemen to strike with both hands in the chest and drive with short, choppy steps with a wide base.\nDuring the off season you may want to contact your coach and see if you can get a copy of the play book.\nHope this helps.

9	should a person get personal on here? either with hate or contempt?? i owe everyone on yahoo answers an apology, i wrote some hateful things about banana bean 01 , i let her get too me with  her remarks,i was wrong  and i just want to say i am sorry...i am not that kind of person and i think i should just let you know!!! I think hatred and contempt gets in the way of the debate.\n\nFYI Banana Bean had an impostor for a while who was over the line. I don't know if some of the things you reacted to were things the impostor said.\n\nA couple of decent people got their accounts suspended as a result of the impostor, and since then I haven't seen much of it (although there has been an upsurge in patently fake 'Mexican' radicals).\n\nNice to apologize, though.

9	Is There A Penalty for Leaving the Peace Corps Early? I have a friend who is going into the Peace Corps in a few weeks.  She has cold feet.  She signed the agreement already.  What happens if she backs out? There are a number of volunteers who never finish their assignment; more than half cannot handle the pressure.  So it is quite common.\n\nUntil your friend actually goes to the Staging Location (DC most of the time), she will have the option of easily backing out.  Some people never show up for staging, and some show up but then change their mind or don't pass medical exam.  \n\nOnce over there, it is still possible to quit, and we had about 5 who quit during training out of a group of 67.  She will not be in a massive amount of debt, but if she quits after finishing training she will have to return a certain sum of money -- like relocation allowance, living allowance, things that she should not have spent if she quits early.  \n\nI hope that she will not back out, as the experience is very rewarding.  I greatly enjoyed my time overseas and would like to have extended it, but the bureaucracy only approved a limited number to do so.  \n\nWhat country will she be going to?  What assignment -- teaching, environmental, health?  \n\nLet me know if you and she have any more questions.
9	Do the ends justify the means? So I'm writing a paper about the steel mills in Pittsburgh and the treatment of the workers and the modernist attitude of neglect towards the workers, and one of the things I notice, is that Carnegie especially believed that the ends justified the means, that if he did good work and was charitable, that would wipe out all of his earlier transgressions.\n\nAt the same time as he believed this, the Braddock mills had a twelve hour work day.  You worked all day or all night in the steel mills (doing dangerous manual labor) and then once a week you would work a twenty four hour shift in the mills.  You had every Sunday off.  \n\nThe death rate in the mills was much higher during the twenty four hour shift than other times, due to exhaustion.\n\nOn the other hand, those mills built America.  All the great railroads and early skyscrapers that fueled the American economy came out of there.\n\nSo do the ends (building America) justify the means (killing and maiming and maltreating workers)? It is impossible to achieve moral ends through immoral means. Don't forget, those workers wouldn't have worked at the steel mill if they thought they could have gotten a better job someplace else, so Carnegie et. al. did those men a favor. Ditto for sneaker-making kids in Singapore. Before you go thinking I'm crazy, consider this: from 1750 to 1800(the advent of industrialism in England), the child mortality rate in London dropped 70%. I don't expect you to believe that, I expect you to check the facts yourself. In other words, John Bull saved the lives of many poor people. Isn't it better to work in a loud, dangerous machine shop, than to die of starvation? Also, if it weren't for the factories, there'd be no Labor party. Factory jobs lifted generations of people out of poverty and into the law-making middle class. In this case, the end is a better standard of living, and the means are hard work. Nothing wrong there.
1	will it ever be posible for men to travel at the speed of light? YES.\n\nThough it depends on what you mean by "moving"\n\nIf you mean getting from one place to another as fast or faster than light, it is possible though not currently provable.\n\nThere are a few "workarounds" for the light speed barrier.  My personal favorite was cooked up by Miguel Alcubierre in 1994.  It is called the Alcubierre Metric, or sometimes the Alcubierre Drive.\n\nIt relies on stretching space time in a wave that would carry a potential vessel faster than light, relative to an outside observer.  It works because relative to the space within the wave, the vessel isn't moving at all.  It also avoids the other problems with light speed travel, time dilation and such.\n\nThe problem is no one knows how to build one, but mankind has overcome every obstacle in its way thus far, I think the light speed barrier will be the same.\n\nThose saying something is impossible are usually interrupted by other people doing it.\n\nMore on the Alcubierre Metric here:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive\n\n- Cai

9	Is anyone else offended by the way Memorial Day is used? We are supposed to be reflecting on those who have given the last full measure of devotion for this country.\n\nEverywhere I turn there are adds for the "Great Memorial Day Sale" without even a mention of what it is BESIDE a great day for great values.\n\nI drive down the street on Memorial Day (or Veteran's day or 4th of July) and I don't see flags out anymore.\n\nI am just curious because none of the days mentioned or the flying of the flag is owned by any political party or anything like that.  So, are you offended by it and do you know WHY people stopped caring?  (AND PLEASE, NO POLITICAL RHETORIC - NIETHER PARTY IS TO BLAME FOR THIS). well it's like chirsmas and Easter.Everyone found a new reason to have holidays. We forgot the value of our holidays.

6	What is a self mailer? When something says "The brochure is a self mailer, 81/2 x 14" what does that look like??? It's a brochure that is designed to be folded so the outside panels have the mailing indicia, return address and promotional copy on what would be considered the 'front' of the piece.\n\n81/2 x 14 is too big to pass through normal postal standards, so your dimensions must mean that is the final size of the piece when unfolded.\n\nTry to design the mailer so that when folded, it conforms to USPS 'regular' size mail.
3	I want to send my kids to private school here in southern Ca. Does anyone know of scholarships available? Scholarships are a great way to go.

Don't be shy - they'll have a bunch of resources, starting with what the school can offer, and possibly information about what might also be available from other sources.\n\nNote that loans must be repaid, but scholarships do not.

He is still friends with her and it causes problems for us because I am uncomfortable with their friendship. I want to stay with him but it is difficult because he refuses to stop talking to her. It isn't fair of me to ask him to stop talking to her and I want to be ok with it. if i was u i wouldent really care cause he my man and after that lil accident he is now come back to me for kisses and hugs if anything you should rub it in her face and show you dont care if you show jealousy she gonna use that againt you and really try be friendly with him more and also show you aint mad at the game or the player and stop askin not to talk to her because all he gonna think is that you jealous and he gonna tell her and she gonna be likeing that and she gonna tell him to brake up with you and stuff so just do what you do and pay no attention to her

0	Please Opine:  Tolerance? Dear friends, every day I hear some of you say "I'm broke, I can't afford giving charity."  And yet each day I also see how intolerant you are toward each other.  You forgive nothing; you set yourselves up as severe judges, not considering if you would like to be treated the same way.  But isn't tolerance a form of charity?\n(A Guardian Spirit - Lyon 1861)\nTaken from:\nThe Gospel Explained by the Spiritist Doctrine\nCompiled by Allan Kardec I think intolerance is based on jealousy.\nSome people can't cope with the fact that I don't need them to be happy. Yet, there they are wanting me to be there with them.\n\nI don't see how tolerance can be charity if it's unwanted, but to make tolerance mandatory is.\n\nYou can't have it all, you have to do it with what you've got, because what you've got, some other person hasn't...Be grateful for what you have, don't take it for granted.

If they do not respond, contact your credit card company.  Once they see that you have tried to resolve the issue, they will get involved and will most likely credit your card right away.  \n\nGood luck!

3	i want to know about crop trapping in IPM? i want complete information about crop trapping Pest-Resistant Crops\nOne of the mainstays of integrated pest management is the use of crop varieties that are resistant or tolerant to insect pests and diseases. A resistant variety may be less preferred by the insect pest, adversely affect its normal development and survival, or the plant may tolerate the damage without an economic loss in yield or quality. Disease-resistant vegetables are widely used, whereas insect-resistant varieties are less common but nonetheless important. Examples include varieties of wheat which have tough stems that prevent development of the Hessian fly and cucurbits (squash, cucumbers, melons) that have lower concentrations of feeding stimulants (cucurbitacins) for cucumber beetles. Commercial corn lines with increased concentration of a chemical called DIMBOA display resistance to European corn borer, a major pest throughout the world. In the case of cabbage, the only reliable method of controlling onion thrips is through the use of resistant varieties.\n\nhttp://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/ent/biocontrol/info/ipmtact.html

7	What's the big deal with The Strokes? I think the reason much is made of The Strokes is that they are an "authentic" rock and roll band.  When their first album came out in '99 - '00 the airwaves were saturated with the likes of boy and girl singers, who were just not rock and roll by any stretch.  I think the Strokes represented a true alternative to that.  Kind of like when Nirvana came and blew away the hair metal bands.  I think The Strokes did a similar thing (though by no means are they at Nirvana's level).\n\nAnyhow, I think they are stil taken seriously because their music is rock 'n' roll.  It's edgy.  And they are a really good live act.  Of course this is all my opinion.  But if you listen to their albums, you can judge for yourself.
8	Ladies,what do you expect your man to get you this Valentines day?explain in full detail...? In my opinion, if you love somebody, you don't expect for anything in return.

So basically I don't expect anything. I'll just be happy that the love in our hearts for each other remains.

I'd say that's a clear cut case of a girl hanging with a guy after a few drinks he asks if he could kiss her she says no but gives in and they kiss anyways, but then they see eachother again sober, he is all nice and holds hands, hugs her blah blah but no kiss...when saying bye she is ready to walk away but he reaches out for a hug she hugs, he hugs tight and kisses her on the lips but a regular kiss with closed lips so she does the same.\n\nSorry.

4	what is 64 bit processor? In computer architecture, 64-bit is an adjective used to describe integers, memory addresses or other data units that are at most 64 bits (8 octets) wide, or to describe CPU and ALU architectures based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size.\n\n\nAs of 2004, 64-bit CPUs are common in servers, and have recently been introduced to the (previously 32-bit) mainstream personal computer arena in the form of the AMD64, EM64T, and PowerPC 970 (or "G5") processor architectures.\n\nAlthough a CPU may be 64-bit internally, its external data bus or address bus may have a different size, either larger or smaller, and the term is often used to describe the size of these buses as well. For instance, many current machines with 32-bit processors use 64-bit buses (e.g. the original Pentium and later CPUs), and may occasionally be referred to as "64-bit" for this reason. The term may also refer to the size of an instruction in the computer's instruction set or to any other item of data (e.g. 64-bit double-precision floating-point quantities are common). Without further qualification, however, a computer architecture described as "64-bit" generally has integer registers that are 64 bits wide and thus directly supports dealing both internally and externally with 64-bit "chunks" of integer data.

2	Any personal trainers who want to help an "old" lady?? Please?!? I have had it... I am stuck stuck stuck at 193 lbs for over a month.  I'm not sneaking food, I'm not sitting on my middle aged butt, something has to give.  I have had my thyroid checked, it's fine, I was losing about a pound a week but it just stopped and nothing seems to work.  I do have some physical workout limitations, but the treadmill is fine, I do 1-1/12 miles 4 days a week interval setting, any more than that my back injuries start to flair up.  I'm also doing resistance training 20 minutes 5 times a week.  Guys, if you saw what I eat every day you'd wonder what's wrong, too.\n80 ounces of water religously, no caffiene, no sugar, no dairy, protein shake or meat twice a day, I'm really trying here!  THIS SUCKS!!!   Anyone have any ideas????? Please?? I'm not a personal trainer, but have you tried changing your routine. exercise more one day and less one day the same with diet. you need to shake up your plan doing the same thing all the time can put you on a plateau.\n\nPS I just don't know why some have to be so rude,but then it's their lack of maturity and vanity.. Good Luck!!!!

1	jus one simple answer that connect on wat is the chemical and physical property of iodine?? < i·o·dine (ī'ə-dīn', -dĭn, -dēn') \nn.\n(Symbol I)2 A lustrous, grayish-black, corrosive, poisonous halogen element having radioactive isotopes, especially I 131, used as a medical tracer and in thyroid disease diagnosis and therapy. Iodine compounds are used as germicides, antiseptics, and dyes. Atomic number 53; atomic weight 126.9045; melting point 113.5°C; boiling point 184.35°C; specific gravity (solid, at 20°C) 4.93; valence 1, 3, 5, 7. \nA liquid containing iodine dissolved in ethyl alcohol, used as an antiseptic for wounds.\n[French iode, iodine (from Greek ioeidēs, violet-colored : ion, violet + -oeidēs, -oid) + –INE2.]\n\n\niodine (ī'ədīn, –dĭn) [Gr.,=violet], nonmetallic chemical element; symbol I; at. no. 53; at. wt. 126.9045; m.p. 113.5°C; b.p. 184.35°C; sp. gr. 4.93 at 20°C; valence −1, +1, +3, +5, or +7. Iodine is a dark-gray to purple-black, lustrous, solid element with a rhombic crystalline structure. It is the least active of the halogens, which are found in group VIIa of the periodic table. It is normally diatomic, i.e., it has 2 iodine atoms in each molecule, in the solid, liquid, and vapor states. When heated it passes directly from the solid to the vapor state (sublimation), the vapor having an intense violet color and a characteristic irritating odor. Iodine is only slightly soluble in water but dissolves readily in a solution of sodium or potassium iodide. Tincture of iodine is a solution of iodine and potassium iodide in alcohol. Iodine also dissolves in carbon disulfide, carbon tetrachloride, and chloroform, giving a deep violet solution. Iodine forms many compounds. With hydrogen it forms hydrogen iodide, which in water solution becomes hydriodic acid. It forms compounds with certain nonmetals (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen) and with most metals. Iodine is displaced from its compounds by the other halogens. The element is obtained from salt deposits, as from the saltpeter beds in Chile, where it occurs in small quantities as an iodate, and from the salt brines associated with some oil wells in California and Louisiana. It is also found as an iodide in the ash of certain seaweeds. Iodine may be prepared by displacement from its compounds with chlorine. Treating an iodide with manganese dioxide and sulfuric acid sublimes the iodine. Iodine is important in medical treatment; tincture of iodine and iodoform are widely used. Iodine is employed in the preparation of certain drugs and in the manufacture of some dyes. Silver iodide, a yellow salt, is used in photography; it is water insoluble and turns black when exposed to light. Starch turns deep blue (almost black) in the presence of a small amount of iodine; this reaction serves as a test for either starch or iodine. Iodine in small amounts is essential to human nutrition; in the thyroid gland it becomes a part of the iodine-containing hormones. Goiter, a swelling of the thyroid, is often a symptom of inadequate iodine in the diet. Iodine has only one stable isotope, iodine–127; it is the only isotope of iodine occurring in nature, although 24 iodine isotopes are known. Iodine–131 is a radioactive isotope with a half-life of 8 days. It is used medically to diagnose abnormalities of the thyroid gland. It is also a component of fallout produced by nuclear explosions. Iodine was discovered in 1811 by Bernard Courtois.

1	to a natural horizon - ie no hills in the way - how far is the horizon - in miles please? How far away the horizon is depends on the height your eyes are at.  A taller person will be able to see farther than a short person, and a person at the top of a building or other tall object will be able to see much much farther.\n\nFor a person of average height standing in a featureless field  (i.e. the ocean) the horizon would be about 3 miles away.\n\nThis website: http://www.boatsafe.com/tools/horizon.htm  will give you the distance to the horizon based on your height.

1	There were 18 of these in 2005.  To do with nature? There were more than 18 hurricanes in 2005. However, there was a report released in Science Magazine in September of 2005 that the number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has nearly doubled (I believe the rise was actually 80%) over the past three decades, to an average of 18 per year. That doesn't exactly answer your question because the year wasn't over when that number came out, and it is an average, but that number made a lot of headlines. I think that annual average number of hurricanes may be your answer. \n\nThis is important because this is being tied to effects of global warming, and the threat of things getting even worse.

Think the dirty, rags-wearing, hobo bit is an act? they really drove to their corner in a Lexus and have a Razr cell phone in their pocket?

8	Why is he acting like this? Me and my ex-boyfriend were really good friends for about 2 years before we started dating. I would say we were best friends.  We were attracted to one another but we were both afraid that a relationship was going to ruin our friendship. However we eventually got together. It was good at first but after a while our situations changed and we felt that it was best that we go beack to being friends so we could both concentrate on ourselves. We were still cool for a long period after that, then he started acting funny. He would try to make me jealous sometimes by mentioning other girls or doing things like that. Then for some reason we just stoppped talking. Now that we have a few classes together we see each other practically everyday. When classes first started we would talk and text each other and things went back to normal. Now he will look dead at me sometimes and wont say anything. Then he'll call out of the blue and want to talk for hours. I'm confused. Why is he doing this? Relationships are complicated...period. \n\nInstead of investing your time and mental energy trying to figure him out, I would take time to focus on the things that make you happy or things that deserve more attention.

9	Are conservatives interested in knowing the truth about global warming or not? I just posted the following link;\n\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686\n\nIt describes a systematic study of ALL published research by climatologists in the field of climate change for a TEN year period. They wanted to know how many of the 928 papers disagreed with an international statement as follows;\n\n"the consensus of scientific opinion is that Earth's climate is being affected by human activities: "Human activities ... are modifying the concentration of atmospheric constituents ... that absorb or scatter radiant energy. ... [M]ost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations"\n\nThey found ZERO out of 928 papers disagreed.  When I posted it conservatives said; http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkyrC7JZ8DcRb.HCP5Rd0Frsy6IX?qid=20061102112730AAFtN9W\n\nAre they just not interested in knowing the truth or just plain dumb?\n\nAnd scorbore I checked your links; one is an editorial by a Some of us are interested in the whole truth. 928 papers you think that is even close to all the papers written on the subject that is probably only one years worth. And notice your own quote says "most of the warming" and "is likely" not exactly words you use when you have a proven fact. When I was in college in the 80's we where taught that emissions where leading to an ice age. Global cooling was the concern maybe that is why a large precentage of Americans don't believe in global warming to many theories have been thrown out. I read papers on global warming and I wiegh them against other facts I don't buy it. Claude Allegre, a French scientist who supported the global warming theory 20 years ago and was once a supporter of the Kyoto accords, recently came forward and said it now appears to him that the theory is wrong. Other scientist put him down and said he "was once respectable". How do you explain everyones rush to close out any debate. You talk about conservatives but they are not they ones running around saying the debate is over and falsifying data( The Hockey Stick Graph) How can a scientist at the forefront of your cause defect and you call me ignorant and uninformed. Are you interested in the truth? Or are you more interested in convincing people there is no debate so they don't seek differing opinions.
4	Why do you think they deleted my question? I posted two questions related to sexuality. The language whas direct but not pornographic. ("what was it like the first time you gave a woman oral sex?" AND "Do you always make your woman orgasm before you do?") \nDo you think Yahoo Answers is being too conservative and prude? I see questions like those and more explicit around all the time.\n\nI suspect someone doesn't like you and reports your every post. Perhaps you have attacked Christians in one of your replies, or you have made it clear you're not from the USA.\n\nSome Christians and US people hate it when non-Christians or non-Americans use these boards. They will follow you around reporting your every post, and will get many deleted.
3	are some parts in comedy so closely tied to culture and time that they must change? Yes, definitely.  Comedians can do skits that are hysterical and appropriate when new, but 10, 20 years later the jokes are not funny.  Why?  Because the times have changed, people have changed (and aged).  It's like music - a hit is a great song for awhile.  The hit didn't change, but the people/times have.  To stay (or get back on the charts), the song needs to be updated, as does the comedian's jokes, if he wants to stay on top.\n\nAn example of how times have changed, might be George Carlin's "Seven Words" skit.  There "were" seven words that could not be used on television [Da*n, f*ck, he*l...].  But now, a lot of those words are used without hesitating or censorship, and the skit is not funny (unless you remember those days - or Carlin changes his skit to reflect the difference between then and now -- which he has, I believe).

0	Is it true that in a Moslem's marriage life,  women always weaker than man ? e.g. when a father passed away, son has bigger portion of the heritage than doughter. Actually, no. Islam promotes equality, but men and women can not be dealt with at the same level, due to a difference in their make up. Their rights are even, b/c both play major roles as slaves of Allah, both have rights to inheritance, land, property, and both play major roles in their married lives, in social life, etc etc. \n\nThe only reason a man gets a bigger portion (twice) as the woman, is because a woman keeps her own portion and does not have to share it with anyone (unless, of course, she wants to.) A man must not only take care of himself, but provide for the women in his family with that money, so he gets more. :) \n\nWomen are very honored in Islam, and they are considered far from weak. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)'s own wife was a leader in society - as a teacher, a political leader, and a religious leader as well. :)

Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n"The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for "students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices." Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.

9	CARPET BOMBING! Isn't  more heinous than suicide bombing? We have learnt that in carpet bombing, bunker bursting, etc. it is impossible to ascertain casualties, both targeted and collateral. Carpet bombing has not been used in Iraq.  Generally it is a technique used in warfare where there are massed troops and that doesn’t meet needs in terrorists based wars.\n\nBunker bursting bombs are very different from carpet bombing.  They are part of the targeted bombing techniques and are used to get very specific sites or small groups of the enemy.  \n\nBoth carpet bombing and smart bombs are used to target military.\n\nNone of these bombing techniques are comparable to suicide bombing.  Suicide bombing is targeted at civilians and is used to terrorize a society. \n\nAll bombing has the common characteristic of killing and injuring those outside of the targeted area and group because that is the nature of bombing.  It is the intent of those doing the bombing which is important.  Do they intend to hit militants or do they target civilians.  Currently, it is the terrorists who intend to kill and harm civilians.

WHILE WATCHING A CLASSIC FOOTBALL GAME THE OTHER NIGHT, I REALIZED THAT THE OLD CLIPPING PENALTY IN FOOTBALL IS NO LONGER CALLED THAT WAY.

It's getting more and more scarce...because the league and players recognize it as a dirty play that could ( and has ) end/ended careers.

1	why is snow white and ice transparrent? While snow is ice it is not as dense as normal ice or an ice cube.  The molecules in an ice cube have formed without much air, which allows them to bond very closely to each other when water turns into a solid.  Snow on the other hand forms in air and the molecules are not as densely packed - which gives it many edges to refract light and thus the "white" appearance.

6	When explorers came to Ontario in the 1600s what tribe of indians did they find along the St.Lawrence river? PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There appears to be a lot of tribes...and it would help if the exact time in the 1600's were given. Apparently the earliest records of the area claim that Ontario was mainly occupied by the Algonquian and Iroquoian nations (indian tribes). However the first European to get there was Jacques Cartier and he made his way up the St. Lawrence river and met what he called the "St. Lawrence Iroquoians" at Quebec City in 1535. Now obviously I realize that you asked for explorers in the 1600's so the next person would then be Samuel de Champlain who visited the same area in 1603, however the tribes that Jacques saw were gone. According to my research, that area during the late 1500's and throughout most of the 1600's had gone through several different (tribal) wars as well as "European vs. tribe" wars. The St. Lawrence river then became what is referred to as "no man's land" until the Iroquois came out victorious in battle. Another European finally visted the same stretch of land that the two previous explorers visited and there, met up with the Iroquois nation. However this was in 1673 and the time might be a little to late for your question. \n\nRegardless my best guess would be the Iroquois nation; seeing as how the "St. Lawrence Iroquoians" were halfly influenced by the Iroquois nation (the other half being the Huron nation) plus the phrase sounds more like a nickname than anything else. Hope I helped. \nQuestions about the issue: CanDo417@e-garfield.com
1	What are the methods to solve an equation with more than one variable? First I would like to know how to solve equations that both have x, and y.I've managed before with help, but forgotten. Then, maybe examples of equations with 3 variables? I am sure such an equation is present in higher algebra and precalculus, and whatnot, but I'm curious.If anyone gives an example, how would the rules differ for a system of solving equations? Here is the rule: you have to have the same number of equations as you have variables to solve.  For example:\n\nx + y = 1\n\nx - y = 1\n\nHere you have two equations and two unknowns.  The process is to solve one equation for one of the variables, and substituting that into the other:\n\nx = 1 - y\n\n(1-y) -y = 1\n\nNow you solve the new equation for y:\n\n-2y = 0\ny = 0\n\nNow you plug y into any of the equations (preferably the easier one), and you get x.\n\nx + 0 = 1\n\nx = 1\n\nOf course this gets more complicated with each new variable and equation, but the process is the same.  You keep substituting until you get one equation with one variable.

1	please help me? Two point-source loudspeakers are a certain distance apart, and a person stands 12.0 m in front of one of them on a line perpendicular to the baseline of the speakers. If the speakers emit identical 1000.0-Hz tones, what is their minimum nonzero separation so that the observer hears little or no sound? (Take the speed to be exactly 340 m/s.) There must be destuctive interference.\n\nNow, wavelength = 0.34 m\n\nPath difference is sqrt(x^2+144) - 12\n\nThis must equal an integral or half number of wavelengths.\n\nTake the simplest case of phase diff. = pi\n\nSo, path difference = 0.34/2 = 0.17\n\nSo, sqrt(x^2+144) = 12.17\n\nor x = 2.027 m
5	Why is soccer so unsuccessful here in the states? It's unfortunate because it is such an exciting and uniting sport.  Hockey doesn't do very well in the states either.  Get with the program you ignorant fools!!  Talk about ethnocentric! I'm going to disagree with the general consensus here believing that soccer is unpopular in the States because of its slow pace. Think about this carefully. What other popular (granted it's not as popular as american football) sport in America is quite similar to soccer? Yes, that's right. HOCKEY. Hockey matches usually end in scores of a total of 10 points or less. \n\nYou want to know the real reason why Soccer is not popular? Two reasons: \n1) The game is quite harsh to aggressive behaviour. This is where a crucial difference lies between Hockey and Soccer. (This is also why Austrialians tend to like rugby over soccer).\n2) Because America doesn't dominate Soccer.\n\nFurthermore, Americans should begin to enjoy Soccer more because their national team is (I'm not debating this) getting better with every tourney. Afterall, there were many Americans in Germany rooting for their team and the TV ratings for football beat ratings for basketball, baseball, hockey and golf (granted, this is because of the large number of immigrants in the states but nevertheless, an important statistic but don't also forget that World Cup this year is held in Germany which means games won't be aired primetime).\n\n"It's also not a very technical sport, in comparison to baseball and football, which rely heavily on strategy and analysis of situations and tendencies." \n\nExcuse me? Ever heard of the 4-2-3-1 defense? or 4-3-3 or 4-4-2? The very fact that Soccer is quite harsh in terms of penalties makes it more technical then baseball and football. Typical American ignorance. Oh and honestly, baseball being a technical sport? Rubbish.

0	What is the derivation of the term "bee's knees"? In the first half of the last century, America was on the rise in the world, and there seemed to be an exuberance in the language, which is sort of silly in retrospect. From earlier slang like "absquatulate", they moved on to stuff like "twenty-three skidoo" and finally to the song "Mairzy Doats". So, after finding the following on the web, I vote for "it just sounded nutty in an American way" so people liked it:\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary records the expression  bee's knee as meaning the type of something small or insignificant from 1797. The plural form is US slang dating from the 1920s, when there was an explosion of terms meaning 'the acme of excellence': compare the cat's whiskers/pyjamas. The first example is dated 1923. Some of these have lasted, and some have not (the flea's eyebrows, the canary's tusks).\n\nOR \n\nA bee's "corbiculae", or pollen-baskets, are located on its\ntibiae (midsegments of its legs).  The phrase "the bee's knees", meaning "the height of excellence", became popular in the U.S. in the 1920s, along with "the cat's whiskers" (possibly from the use of these in radio crystal sets), "the cat's pajamas" (pyjamas were still new enough to be daring), and similar phrases which made less sense and didn't endure:  "the eel's ankle", "the elephant's instep", "the snake's hip".  Stories in circulation about the phrase's origin include:  "b's and e's", short for "be-alls and end-alls"; and a corruption of "business".

8	How did the beauty of our feminine forms and the mystery of our sexuality as women become so cheap and common? Women all over the world are crying out, "I don't like what I see. I want my clothing back! I want my dignity, honor, and mystique restored. I want to push away fear. I want to be empowered and free!" How did we move so far from the hope and promise of lasting loving relationships and have accepted a jaded and cynical view of relationships? It was the women's liberation movement.  Now women are denying their emotions all for causal sex and claiming they are happy in those relationships.   Women were never emotionally prepared or created to jump from one man's bed into another.   Women seem to think this has put them on the same level as a man in sexual freedom.  The men are excited because now they are relieved from any obligation, responsibilities and developing maturity in a relationship. They can have their cake and eat it too.  We as women need to demand more from men.   If we do not encourage them to be in a responsible relationship they will never commit. \n  I know there are those that claim they are happy and I have had a few friends claim the same.  The truth is that it tears down a woman's self-esteem and she gets to the point that she beleives she is not worthy of a good relationship so she settles for second best....an occassion rump in the hay with whomever.  \n\nOh yeah, then you have the good women who know how to treat a man and have a good stable relationship and we meet the men who have been with these "sexual liberated" woman and they expect the same from us. \n\nIt is no wonder the men are so irresponsible and take relationship so causally.
9	Name one thing you respect about the opposing party's views or one thing you dislike about your own party. Work hard...you can do it.  I appreciate the Democrat's concern about our right to freedom of speech, even the speach we abhore. One thing I dislike about the Democratic party is its inability to properly organize itself and its issues.  Our population is majority democrat, but so many democrats cannot or choose not to vote.  I also think that a lot of liberals have holier than thou values about Christianity (they think that the only smart people out there are atheists), which are kind of hypocritical of liberal ideals. \n\nI like the patriotism of a lot of Republicans.  They're really into that heartwarming, feel good to be an American stuff.  Even like the president running around with that soldier who lost his legs in Iraq.  I think that's just a pretty cool thing to do.

2	a person who mentaly multi tasks, diagnosed as such. how can they survive in a normal thinking world? few people truly multi task, most switch between tasks. those who really multi task have difficulty surviving in a single task world. people think they are retarded or worse. if asked to say the alphabet, they would say "a" then "z". most people will say "a-b-c--all the way to z". some true multi task people have had their children taken by the state because no one understands them or how their brain works. where can one find documentation to assist with understanding. If, when asked to recite the alphabet, one says "a" followed by "z" and then stops, that person has not multi-tasked because the task has not been completed regardless of sequencing issues.  Multi-tasking only occurs when the given task is executed to completion.  Either your example is flawed or the assumption of multi-tasking is flawed.\n\nIn computing, multi-tasking requires a minimum of 3 processes: two processes that share the assigned work and one that supervises the functional tasks to insure that they are performed in sequence (and sequencing does matter) and monitors for completion of tasks A and B.  These processes can be assigned to three different CPUs.  While the human brain does have multiple parts, I have not heard of cognition occuring separately in the parts.\n\nIs it possible to think two distinctly different thoughts simultaneously?  My inclination is to say no, the subject is merely jumping from one thought to another and back rapidly - not truly multi-tasking.  Can you cite the basis and origin(s) of the multi-tasking diagnosis?  Would very much like to follow up on this interesting line of thought.
9	Is it possible to imagine what the U.S. will be like in 10 years?

1	how does the animal kestrel deal with problems found in the city? Some Falcon species like peregrines and probably kestrels use tall city buidings to hunt and nest on as if they were cliff faces. The buidings, like cliffs, act as good vantage points (provide updrafts) to hunt other birds. As long as there is plenty of prey items like feral pigeons (peregrines) or mice to hunt (kestrels) they probably don't have many problems living in cities. Heavy pollution could be a problem?

1	friction & pulley? hi,\nr there any forces of friction that can affect the mechanical advantage of a pulley?\ncan you explain, please?\nthank u very much for any help First we have to go over what is the advantage of a pully.  a pully destrebutes the forces around the pully, so that you do not have the full force in one single point.  \nThis advantage is present weather the pulley turns or not.  For example rock climbers will wrap a rope around a tree to help pull somebody up a cliff.   \nnow a rock climber would love to use a pulley instead of a tree but the point is the advantage is still there with the tree.  \nSo from this you can get that the friction of the base holding the center of the pulley would effect the advantage of the pulley.  \nbut you would have to also say what do you want?  the more friction there is the harder it is to pull but like in the case of the tree and the rock climber, if he stops pulling the other climber will not fall.  As apposed to having a pulley where the rock climber will be easy pulling up but if he stops pulling the rock climber will fall down.  \nso it comes down to what is the advantage of having a pulley. \n\n\nhope this helps\n-David-

To save us both and not pull me down with him, he broke up with me. \nDuring that time, I found another guy and we went out. We did some things I now regret. Later on after we did them my mom found out, but it was after that guy and I were already broke up.\n\nMuch later after he and I were broke up, my first ex and I began to date again. During the whole time we never lost contact or our love for one another. I was so happy, life was falling back into place. But now, my 1st ex, who was the current boyfriend; semi-broke up with me. I say 'semi' because he said he wasn't breaking up, he just needed a mutual seperation because of the distance. ur still young. give yourself time. experience life more. expand ur mind first. that's why ur mom wanted to know if u date cuz then if u needed advice she can offer them to u. she's just there to protect u. not trying to ruin ur life or anything.

1	are there any good websites for information on mount vesuvius out there? please post a link p.s no timewasters Vesuvius (vəsū'vēəs) , Ital. Vesuvio, only active volcano on the European mainland, S Italy, on the eastern shore of the Bay of Naples, SE of Naples. The height of the main cone changes with each eruption, varying within a few hundred feet of the 4,000-ft (1,219-m) level; in 1969 the height was 4,190 ft (1,277 m). The second summit, Monte Somma (3,770 ft/1,149 m) is a ridge that half encircles the cone and is separated from it by a valley (c.3 mi/5 km long). The sides of Vesuvius are deeply scarred by lava flow, but its lower slopes are extremely fertile, dotted with villages, and covered with vineyards which produce the famous Lachryma Christi wine. The base of the mountain (circumference c.45 mi/70 km) is encircled by a railroad, and a chairlift reaches almost to the rim of the crater (diameter c.2,300 ft/700 m). On the western slope, at 1,995 ft (608 m), there is a seismological observatory (built 1840–45). The outline of Vesuvius forms part of the backdrop of Naples; it is often surmounted by a faint plume of smoke.\nThe earliest recorded eruption (A.D. 79) was described by Pliny the Younger in two letters to Tacitus; the eruption buried Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae under cinders, ashes, and mud. Pliny the Elder was killed by the eruption, which he had come to investigate. Frequent eruptions have been recorded since Pompeii was destroyed, notably in 512, in 1631, six times in the 18th cent., eight times in the 19th cent. (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929, and 1944. The eruptions vary greatly in severity, but the geological record shows that Vevusius experiences a truly devastating eruption every 2,000–3,000 years.\n\nI had a bundle more info for you but you dont allow e-mails,, sorry\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9	Do conservatives question Authority less than liberals? True conservatives no, why do you think we defend the Free Exercise of Religion Clause and the Second Amendment as hard as we do.  It's the conservatives that raised a ruckus about Harriet Myers.  Conservatives are the ones demanding the current immigration laws be enforced and those breaking the law be arrested.  Conservatives have questioned the Supreme Court and the 9th Circuit Court.  \n\nConservatives question, but we don't take to the streets as a general rule, we vote, we write letters, and we make phone calls
9	How do we live in a "free" country, but only if you're the same genre of religion as the President? If we live in a country of "freedom", which I served in the Military to help preserve, then why can you walk around with a Bible, and a necklace with a torture device on it (Crucifix) but NOT a Pentagram?  And please remember that Paganism (the worship of multiple Deities) IS a recognized religion by the Government...In deference to George Bush.... i know several people that follow the old religion and they have bumper stickers and pentagrams showing and with the exception of a few loons they have no trouble at all. you are free to worship goats, the moon, cow patties, or anything else here without government interference and as long as your practices do not conflict with existing laws [ you could not practice human sacrifice for example] you can pretty much do as you please. personally i have not seen any example of GWB doing anything to interfere with your practicing your religion or anyone elses unless you consider defending the country from islamic nutcases to be interfering with beliefs.

9	Who is Chandrababu Naidu? Nara Chandra Babu Naidu (born April 20, 1951) was the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh during 1995-2004. He holds the record of being the longest serving chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nHe is currently the leader of the Telugu Desam Party, the second largest party in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nMr. N. Chandra Babu Naidu was born in the Naravaripally village of Chittoor district on 20th April, 1950. He did his Masters in Economics from the Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati. He was working towards a Ph.D. degree at the same university, when he took to politics.\n\nNaidu is married to Mrs. Bhuvaneswari and has a son Lokesh. His father-in-law, the late Mr. Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao, was one of the most accomplished film actors of Telugu cinema, who later founded the Telugu Desam Party and was also the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.
2	Is sodium lauroy, an ingredient found in toothpaste and shampoo, harmful? l? Does sodium lauroyl cause cancer? No. It's a myth.\n\nThis is another myth/hoax/urban legend. The American Cancer Society has this to say about 'sodium lauroy' (Sodium Laureth Sulfate):\n\n"Shampoo \n \nRumor:\n\nOne chain email floating through cyberspace says a common ingredient in many health and beauty aids is known to cause cancer. The warning reads: “Check the ingredients listed on your shampoo bottle, and see if they have this substance by the name of Sodium Laureth Sulfate, or simply SLS. This substance is found in most shampoos, and the manufacturers use it because it produces a lot of foam and it is cheap. BUT the fact is that SLS is used to scrub garage floors, and it is very strong. It is also proven that it can cause cancer in the long run. I went home and checked my shampoo (Vidal Sasoon), it doesn't contain it; however, others such as Vo5, Palmolive, Paul Mitchell, the new Hemp shampoo, etc. contains this substance." \n\nFact:\n\nSodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and its chemical cousin sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) are known irritants, not known carcinogens. SLS and SLES are powerful surfactants (wetting agents) and detergents. They have industrial uses because they are detergents that exert emulsifying action, thereby removing oil and soil. There is no way of knowing where this Internet information comes from, but there are a variety of Web sites offering health and beauty products that are SLS-free. According to David Emery and his Urban Legends website, "All these Web sites are maintained by 'independent distributors' for various multi-level marketing companies hawking natural personal care products. As a matter of fact, the majority of URLs returned in a standard Web search on the keywords 'sodium laureth sulfate' all point to versions of the same propaganda." \n\nhttp://www.cancer.org/docroot/MED/content/MED_6_1x_Shampoo.asp?sitearea=MED

What model Intel CPU is it and what model motherboard is it?\n\nHave you connected the power switch correctly. Just because the board gets power when you press the button doesn't mean it's in the right place. I connected the power button wrong once and the pc would always go on but would not post properly. Put the switch in right and all was well. Try that otherwise the board might be dead, there is a possibility that something might be wrong with the powersupply.
1	From control to tension production, explain the key steps involved in the contraction of a skeletal muscle fib List as many details as possiable This may be more than you wanted, but here goes:\n\nSkeletal muscles contract according to the sliding-filament model:\n\nAn action potential originating in the CNS, reaches the axon of the motor neuron. \nThe action potential activates voltage gated calcium ion channels on the axon, and calcium rushes in. \nThe calcium causes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, within vesicles in the axon to fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the acetylcholine into the synapse between the axon and the motor end plate specialization in the sarcolemma of the muscle. \nThe acetylcholine diffuses across the synapse and binds to nicotinic receptors on the motor end plate, opening channels in the membrane for sodium and potassium. Sodium rushes in, while potassium trickles out through the sodium-potassium (Na/K) pump located in the sarcolemma. However, because sodium is more permeable, the muscle fiber membrane becomes more positively charged, triggering an action potential. \nThe action potential spreads through the muscle fibre's network of T tubules, depolarizing the inner portion of the muscle fibre. \nThe depolarization activates voltage-gated calcium channels in the T tubule membrane, which are in close proximity to calcium-release channels in the adjacent sarcoplasmic reticulum. \nActivated voltage-gated calcium channels physically interact with calcium-release channels to activate them, causing the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium. \nThe calcium binds to the troponin C present on the thin filaments of the myofibrils. The troponin then allosterically modulates the tropomyosin. Normally the tropomyosin sterically obstructs binding sites for myosin on the thin filament; once calcium binds to the troponin C and causes an allosteric change in the troponin protein troponin T allows tropomyosin to move, unblocking the binding sites. \nMyosin (which has ADP and inorganic phosphate bound to its nucleotide binding pocket and is in a ready state) binds to the newly uncovered binding sites on the thin filament. Myosin is now bound to actin in the strong binding state. The release of ADP and inorganic phosphate causes the myosin head to turn, causing a ratchet movement (Actin acts as a cofactor in the release of inorganic phosphate, expediting the release). This will pull the Z-bands towards each other. It also shortens the sarcomere and the I-band. \nATP binds myosin, allowing it to release actin and be in the weak binding state. (A lack of ATP makes this step impossible, resulting in rigor mortis.) The myosin then hydrolyzes the ATP and uses the energy to move into the "cocked back" state while releasing ADP and inorganic phosphate. In general, evidence indicates (predicted and in vivo evidence) that each skeletal muscle myosin head moves 10-12 nm each power stroke, however there is also evidence (in vitro) of variations (smaller and larger) that appear specific to the myosin isoform. \nSteps 7 and 8 repeat as long as ATP is available and calcium is present on thin filament. \nWhile the above steps are occurring, calcium is actively pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When calcium is no longer present on the thin filament, the tropomyosin changes conformation back to its previous state so as to block the binding sites again. The myosin ceases binding to the thin filament, and the contractions cease. \nThe calcium ions leave the troponin molecule in order to maintain the calcium ion concentration in the sarcoplasm. The active pumping of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum creates a deficiency in the fluid around the myofibrils. This causes the removal of calcium ions from the troponin. Thus the tropomyosin-troponin complex again covers the binding sites on the actin fiaments and contraction ceases.\n\nThere are two types of voluntary muscular contractions, eccentric and concentric. In the case of eccentric contraction, the force generated is insufficient to overcome the resistance placed on the muscle and
2	Is it safe to live next to a x-ray clinic? You have to really think about this question.  Have you ever been in a waiting room in a radiology department/facility?  Have you seen all the pregnant women sitting there, waiting for their ultrasounds?  Did you ever think this was a health risk for them?\n\nAny room that is used to take x-rays is shielded with lead in the walls.  You could be on the other side of a wall that x-rays were directed at and have no measurable dose. You could be in a bathroom that shares a wall with a x-ray room and get no dose.  The x-ray room is completely shielded so radiation cannot pass through it.  Don't you think x-ray workers would all be dying of cancer, or at least all have cataracts if this wasn't the case?\n\nHave you ever had a loved one in the ICU?  We also do x-rays in surgery and the emergency department. We do x-rays on portable machines on a regular basis.  If you are not right in the path of the x-ray beam, and if you are not close to that path, there is no exposure.  X-rays do not travel for eternity...they dissipate.  \n\nThe use of x-rays and the rules that surround them are above and beyond what is necessary to protect the public.  These things are tested on an annual basis.  If we don't pass, we don't do x-rays anymore.  \n\nSo, you should feel safe living next to an imaging center.

2	If two people with HIV or AIDS slept together unprotected, would that be ok? Surely you can't catch HIV if you already have it. So is it ok? \n\nThere should be a club, like a dating service where people who have HIV and AIDS can meet up and go out. Because people who have it could never really have totally risk free sex with a non-carrier, the condom could always break. If they slept with another HIV carrier they wouldn't have to worry about explaining their illnesses to the other person or worrying about their reaction. Well if you want to risk getting further complications why would you?\n\nI would be contacting those  STD organisations to seek clarification rather than accepting what anyone here would be telling you....

1	Is there evidence to support the evolution of sexual reproduction from a viral or parasitic origin? Why would selfish, replicating genes choose to engage in a system where the offspring only have half of those present in an adult organism?  why not just fission?  Choosing the chance to not be passed on to the next generation to better enable the offspring to handle environmental changes seems an entirely implausible answer given that genes don't have future thoughts and why would genes choose a 50% chance of not replicating now, versus an Y% chance of not surviving some 'time' later (post environment shift). Sexual reproduction is just better for generating lots of species ... i.e., it increases the adaptation of new organisms to changes in environment, and creates new organisms that can move into new environments.  Whether it is more or less *likely* to originate than asexual reproduction is irrelevant.  (Most of the history of life was without it.)  What matters is that, once it does occur, it is *very* effective at generating *lots* of new organisms that have it ... and it can way outpace asexual reproduction in populating the world with new species that have it.\n\nThis is not to say that asexual reproduction can't work quite well for many organisms that continue to thrive and produce new species through occasional mutation.  But the type of widespread variation and *inventiveness* we see in much of the plant kingdom and all of the animal kingdom, is a direct result of sexual reproduction.  (And I use "inventiveness" metaphorically, as I would use the word "beautiful" ... I of course don't mean "deliberate invention", but just that sexual reproduction can produce 20 different solutions to a problem of survival, 2 or 3 of which survive long enough to branch out new species.)\n\nIn other words, (and this is the key) we see way more sexual than asexual reproduction in plants and animals only because it is *so* effective at generating new species.\n\nOh, and to address your original question, evidence ... the evidence that sexual reproduction arose from asexual organisms includes (1) the fact that the two have exactly the same genetic machinery (same DNA, same orientation of double-helix, same codons, A, C, G, T, same amino acids, same proteins); (2) the fact that the genes themselves have a huge amount of commonality (% of shared genes); and (3) the fact that the amount of this commonality is always consistent with a common-descent model (the % of genes in common between humans, apes, salamanders, sponges, and amoebas don't all have to have a sensible proportions that point to genetic "distance" from each other ... but they do).
8	I've never had an orgasm during sex!!? I'm always able to reach orgasm through other stuff, but never during sex!! I have tried different positions too but it doesn't work. Is there anything wrong with me? or is is possible that I just couldn't get there with those guys? I've only been with 2 people. I couldn't do it for the longest time either.  i thought i never would.  then i was with a guy that actually cared to find what i like.  it was like the mental block was lifted!  i get off more often than not now.  you just have to know what you like and go for it.  just get lost in the feelings.  deep grinding works well for me, but the g spot is the best. a little messy at times, but definitely worth it.
4	how to connect a web cam? Well, \n\nConnect a webcam to your PC is easy as 1, 2, 3.\n\nIf you are using Window XP and if your webcam has a USB connection (it should) you just simple plug it in the USB gate, wait a few seconds for your computer recognizes a "new guests". A pop up window appears with instruction, follow the instruction and you are done. Normally a webcam comes together with a so-called driver. It is kinda CD goes together with it. You need this CD to install your webcam.\n\nIf you you Window 98 or earlier, you do the same thing but you have to go to Control Pannel > Add new hardware > and on the list look for the CD in CD-rom.\n\nGoodluck

I know it's a PRAXIS test question and I know there are answers posted but I'm more interested in knowing what area of probability I have to bone up on. Thank you one and all. This is really not a probability problem but a logic problem.\nYou ask what the minimum number of beans she must take \nout of her pocket, to ensure that she has one of each color.\nSometimes it is best to turn the question around and work backwards.\nSuppose I told you, "You can choose any marble from my pocket you like, you choose the color.  What is the Most \nmarbles you can pull out and Not have one of each color?"\nWell, first you would pull out 8 red ones, then you could take 4\ngreen ones,  All that are left are blue ones, so when you pull out the 13th marble, you have to have one of each color.\n\nWhen you come up with an answer, all you have to do is find \none case which refutes your answer to tell you it is wrong.\nSay I told you that the minimum was 10 marbles.  You could refute that by showing me one case where you took out  10 marbles and STILL did not have one of each color.\nUse the case where you took out 8 red and 2 green and still\nhad no blue.\nBut you can find no case where you can take out 13 marbles \nand not have one of each.\n\nHope this helps you.  Remember to reason the problem out before plugging in numbers.
9	How can you differ illegal porn from legal porn? illegal porn has illegal actions performed in it such as brutal violence and genuine rape. If the performer is under 18, it is illegal, if the woman says no, it is illegal. There can not be any vulgar actions such as using the opposite sex as a toilet, that is also illegal.

1	what will happen when all the stars burn out ? Remember that the amount of mass and energy in the universe is constant. The mass would eventually condense into a cosmic phenomenon known as the Big Crunch (the exact opposite of the Big Bang). That is what modern physics says, anyway.

3	Which do you think is more important, grades, or popularity? Because my friend is all about how she has the highest GPA in the school and I told her today that I thought that it wasn't all about grades...there was more to life. If you are asking for a straight out answer, then you want the grades. Popularity won't get you into a college, but there are other forces in this decision. One, life is short, and being cool is important too. What's the point of living smart, but friendless when you only live one life? The WHOLE POINT OF LIFE IS TO HAVE FUN! That basically means you must acheive the perfects balance of popularity and brains. That balance however, is up to you to decide.

1	what is the name of the tenth planet in our solar system? The name of the tenth planet is 90377 Sedna.  90377 Sedna is a trans-Neptunian object, discovered by Michael Brown (Caltech), Chad Trujillo (Gemini Observatory) and David Rabinowitz (Yale University) on November 14, 2003. At the time of its discovery it was the most distant observed natural solar system body, though this has now been exceeded by 2003 UB313 (a provisional name). \n\nThis particular scattered disc object, 2003 UB313, originally found in 2003 but confirmed two years later by Mike Brown (Caltech), David Rabinowitz (Yale University), and Chad Trujillo (Gemini Observatory), has renewed the old debate about what constitutes a planet since it is ~30% larger than Pluto with an estimated diameter of 1864 miles. It currently has no name, but has been given the provisional designation 2003 UB313, and has been nicknamed "Xena" by its discoverers, after the television character. It has many similarities with Pluto: its orbit is highly eccentric, with a perihelion of 38.2 AU (roughly Pluto's distance from the Sun) and an aphelion of 97.6 AU, and is steeply inclined to the ecliptic plane, at 44 degrees, more so than any known object in the solar system except the newly-discovered object 2004 XR190. Like Pluto, it is believed to consist largely of rock and ice, and has a moon. Whether it and the largest Kuiper belt objects should be considered planets or whether instead Pluto should be reclassified as a minor planet has not yet been resolved.\n\nSedna is described as a cold planetoid, perhaps as large as two-thirds the size of Pluto. Sedna, the newly discovered Pluto-like object with a gigantic, highly elliptical 10,500-year orbit that takes it from about 76 to 928 AU, has too distant a perihelion to be a scattered member of the Kuiper Belt and could be the first in an entirely new population. 2000 CR105 is also believed to be a member of this population.

2	Having a STD and still having sex? I recently found one of my friends has an STD but continues to have sex, is'nt that against the law or something? because she doesent inform her partners. That sounds horrible!  If she has been diagnosed with an STD, it is reported to the Department of Health. If she knowingly infects someone else and they become infected; they MAY be able to take legal action only if they have proof it was from her. This is difficult because you cannot always prove "when" you were infected. Tell your friend to go to the doctor and seek treatment. Most STDs are curable, but if left untreated many side effects including infertility can occur.

2	When I workout at night the effect doesn't seem to stay the next day.? I work out at night, about 30 or so minutes before I go to bed.

After I workout I go and look at myself in the mirror and I think wow I look good, better than I did before. So I go to sleep and I wake back up and it seems, looks and feels like all the weight flab came back.

And though they're few and far between, some care more about people than money.
5	I love horse's? I would love to work on a throubread horse farm any weir mainly in MI are their any around MI If you work on a Thoroughbred farm, you're going to start at the bottom-- general maintenance and cleanup, i.e., stall-mucking.  Much of the work you'll start out doing will be hard manual labor that doesn't involve hands-on work with the horses.  The work is tough and the pay isn't good.  Also, there may not be any health benefits-- which you may not care about until you desperately need them.\n\nOver time, you'll get to work with the horses more.  While horses are wonderful animals to be around, they are also large animals that can behave unpredictably, and anyone who makes their living handling horses knows that it isn't a question of whether they will ever get hurt by a horse, it's a question of when and how bad. \n\nThis is not to try to discourage you from working with horses, but you have to understand realistically that working with horses can be hard and painful.  It can involve days that begin before the sun is up, when the temperature is below freezing, that don't end until hours after dark.  It can mean being dirty and hot and tired.\n\nAnd the truth is that it just doesn't pay very well.  I have a friend who worked for 15 years at a Standardbred training center.  She broke green two-year-olds, trained racehorses, went to the track with the racehorses, and had her assistant trainer's credential.  After fifteen years of this, she was living in a run-down trailer that didn't have electricity, plumbing or gas, she had no health benefits, no savings, her car was 17 years old and had 190,000 miles on it.\n\nWhen she got an eye infection and ended up having to use the left-over ointment from her dog's eye infection to treat it because she didn't have money for a doctor, she decided that she'd had enough and quit the job.  She works as a pari-mutuel clerk now and has a "day job" as well.\n\nShe doesn't regret the years she spent working with the horses, but memories are all she came away with after 15 years.

2	What exactly is a medical emergency and when is it right to go to the emergency room? Is it just life/death situations? Or what about if you are experiencing pain but you won't die if you wait a day to go to the docotor's office. It takes forever in Canada to wait and even get an x-ray done if you go to the doctor's office. Service is much faster at the emergency room if you might have some sort of infection? You can go to the emergency room for any reason.  It does not have to be a life and death situation.  People go to the ER for diarrhea.  If you feel you need to be seen by a doctor, and you don't want to or can't wait for an appointment with your primary doctor.  Than I would suggest you go, they will see you no matter what your problem is.  You just may have to wait alittle while if there are more serious patients than you.  And the bill may be alittle more than your primary doctor.  But your health and well-being is the most important thing.

2	I just had lab work done and the results show Absolute Basophils as zero. What is this and should it be zero? Basophils are a group of white blood cells which are normally in charge of producing immunoglobulins related to allergic reactions. Their numbers are the least among all white cells (about 100 to 200 per cubic mm of blood). SOmetimes blood tests aren't sensitive enough to detect circulating levels of basophils (they may be residing in certain other tissues in your body), and thus the absolute basophil count may turn out as zero. So don't be too worried about it; if the other indices in your blood work are normal, there shouldn't be a problem.

1	suppose A is a set of formulas and every finite subset of A is satisfiable, then A is satisfiable.? prove this\n\nsatisfiable means that for every finite subset of A, there is a unique truth assignment that will make the subset of formulas true. \n\nalso, why is the intersection of the finite subsets and the truth assignments nonempty? \n\nthis is for my Math 451 class at UNLV There are many proofs, for example via Boolean algebras or compact Hausdorff topological spaces or binary trees and probably more.\n\nFor example, consider the sequence S0, S1, S2, ..., of sets of truth assignments, such that:\n\n a) S0 is the set of all truth assignments\n b) S1 is a subset of S0, S2 is a subset of S1, S3 is a subset of S2, etc.\n c) For every finite subset E of A, every Sn contains at least one truth assignment that satisfies E\n\nNote that by assumption, S0 satisfies condition (c).\n\nEnumerate the propositional letters as p0, p1, p2, ...\n\nGiven that Sn satisfies (c), construct S{n+1} as follows:\n\n let Fn = { truth assignments in Sn such that the value assigned to letter pn is FALSE }\n let Tn = { truth assignments in Sn such that the value assigned to letter pn is TRUE  }\n\nClaim: at least one of Fn and Tn must satisfy clause (c).\n\nWhy?  Suppose that both E1 is a finite subset of A with no satisfying assignment in Fn and E2 is a finite subset of A with no satisfying assignment in Tn.  Then E1 union E2 is also a finite subset of A which can be seen to have no satifying assignment in Sn, contrary to our assumption about Sn.\n\nSo now we define\n\n S{n+1} = Fn if every finite subset of A has a satisfying assignment in Fn, otherwise S{n+1} = Tn\n\nThis way we define S0, S1, S2, ..., Sn, ... so that all Sn have property (c) and each S{n+1} is a proper subset of Sn.\n\nThere is one truth assignment in the intersection of all of the S0, S1, S2, ..., Sn, ....  Why? It is the assignment that assigns FALSE to pn if S{n+1} was Fn and TRUE to pn if S{n+1} was Tn.  It can be seen that both this truth assignment is in the common intersection of the Sn and that no other truth assignment can be.\n\nFinally, the one truth assignment in the common intersection of the Sn is a satifying truth assignment for all of the formulas in A.  I guess the easiest way to see this is that for any finite subset E of A (including the one-element subsets), all of the letters of the formulas in E are pi for 0 <= i < n.  Then since Sn already decides the FALSE or TRUE value of each pi, 0 <= i < n, we see that every truth assignment in Sn decides E the same way: all elements of Sn satify E or all elements of Sn do not satifsy E.  But at least one element of Sn must satisfy E -- so they all do, including the unique truth assignment in the common intersection of all of the Sn.\n\nSo A has at least one satisfying truth assignment.\n\n(You can find others by varying whether you pick Fn or Tn as the next S{n+1} whenever both have property (c)).\n\n\nUpdate: A few hours later I realized the above was essentially the same as saying:\n\nClaim: If A is a finitely satisfiable set of formulas and s is a formula, then at least one of A union { s }, A union { not s } is also finitely satisfiable.\n\nOtherwise there are finite subsets E1 and E2 of A such that neither E1 union { s ] nor E2 union { not s } can be satisfied, when clearly the finite subset E1 union E2 of A cannot be satisfied.\n\nSo in the above construction the sequence S0, S1, S2, ... corresponded to a sequence like for example\n\n A0 = A\n A1 = A0 union { not p0 } if that is finitely satisfiable, otherwise A0 union { p0 } (which then is, by the claim)\n A2 = A1 union { not p1 } if that is finitely satisfiable, otherwise A1 union { p1 } (which then is, by the claim)\n\n...where as before the propositional letters are p0, p1, p2, ....\n\nThen the union of all of the An is finitely satisfiable (because a finite subset would be contained in some finitely satisfiable An along the way) and in fact you can read off a satisfying truth assignment of the union of all of the An because for each letter the union contains either the letter (so assign it TRUE) or its negation (so assign it FALSE).\n\nSame proof, just a different way of looking at it.

So, there is a wide field out there.  Most CJ students look at jobs with the local PDs, Sheriffs, Highway Patrol, ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco & Fire Arms), ABC (Alcohold & Beverage Control), US Marshalls, Border Patrol, DOJ (Department of Justice), Homeland Security, FBI and CIA.  But there is also the correctional facilities, politics and law school to look at if you find those interesting.  These are ideas IF you want to stay in a CJ field.  These types of jobs will make you anywhere from $30 - 100k per year depending on your time of service and rank.  Plan on starting around at $35k  though...\n\nIn reality, only 30% of college grads find a career in their field of study - either through choice or because they couldn'g get the job they were looking for.  Once you graduate, the mere fact that you have a degree will open a lot of doors for you and you may find yourself being the manager of an accounting firm if you want!  With a degree the world is your oyster babe!  Go find your pearl!  =)

However here are two quality resources and very reliable places to start http://www.seo-blog.com/tutorial.php and http://www.seomoz.org/beginners.php\n\nIt's not something you can do and expect to get results quickly. If you follow the advice in the two resources above and put in a bit work now your site should be ranking ready for next years busy period.\n\nAs well as doing SEO for the your long term success you should try PPC probably Google AdWords.

6	DO people like to help? that depends! obviously there ARE people who like to help and there are people who DON'T like to help. but help with "what" is the question? i think if people were asked to help out with fun things then they would be more willing to do it, but with something that's boring and without pay then I'm guessing they'd be less willing

6	I have an unemployement gap of over  5 years. how can i explain it in my CV? my previous job experience is not relevent to my current high qualification Well it depends on what you did. Were you unemployed by choice? Did you choose to stay home for family, to help out a friend or family memeber, to take care of someone who is sick and unable to tend to themselves? Medical reasons? There are a number of reason as to how you can explain the gap.
2	Is anyone else fed up of reading about everybody's obsession with women's weight??!? Im so annoyed to find myself checking the amount of calories and fat on packets recently, and I've never even been remotely overweight!  Surely we're all in agreement we don't want to look like Nicole Richie and the like anyway??  And do they even seem happy??  Life's too short, let's enjoy it for god's sake, you could die tomorrow..morbid but true! I agree that many women spend too much time on the "weight issue".\nI think it's a pity that they haven't realized that looking like a teenage boy isn't attractive to men like me who appreciate a more womanly looking figure.\nThe majority of us are sick of "Barbies" and other "plastic personalities".\nAn inner radiance and honest personality is far more important.
8	I'm about to go to school with my ex that I am still in love with. We dated for 2.5 yrs. What should I do? We said we would just be feinds, but I'm not sure that I can, and I will be around him alot, because it is a small College, and we are in the same activities. All I want is to be with him, but I don't know if I will be able to see him with other girls, and It will be wierd every time I am interested in a guy as well. I still wish i had an answer as to why he broke up with me, but he just called after he moved to tell me it was over. we haven't talked much, because I don't want to call him and be desperate, and he has never been good about calling anyone. I love him so much, but i don't want another relationship with him until i can trust him anyways. How do i act around him and deal with other people who have heard of me from him. who knows what he has said about me. Advice would be appreciated. sweetie, i feel for you.  your in a tough situation but if you can get through the first day of being near him then it will get easier each day until you don't even care if he is there.  \n\nwhen a guy breaks up with you without a reason and you have been together for 2.5 years then he is an insensitive jerk.  \n\nI know you love him but don't go to school thinking this is our second chance.  he knows where you have been if he want a second chance.  see if there other activities you may be interested in that he won't be there.  \n\nact like you could care less about him when you are around him.  be civil but thats it.  when around people you think they may have been told something about you follow this rule, kill them with kindness.  that way they have no reason to believe anything your ex says.\n\ngood luck, make new friends, and have fun in college.  join a sorority.
8	My boyfriend's parents constantly BRAG to me about everything: their nice house, money, and trips to Vegas. So I told my boyfriend their bragging annoyed me and made me feel bad about all that I DON'T have. He got pissed at me for "JUDGING" his parents and insisted they did nothing wrong. He is still very pissed, and I don't know what to do. Am I wrong? Your wrong to some degree but so is he and so are they.  People tend to be proud of their lives and they most often express that pride to family which is you and your boyfriend.  Yes, they probably carry it too far, but I doubt if it is meant to make you feel bad.  Your boyfriend is wrong because he shouldn't be mad at you.  He should have been understanding and talked you about it.  There was no reason to be mad at you for your feelings regardless of if he believed them or not.
2	How long does it take to recover from laprascopy? I'm having laprascopy to remove a migrant IUD.  What will the recovery be like?  How long would something like that normally take?  All the Dr said was that I might be sore for 24-48 hrs.  It's kind of a last minute thing so I've only talked to him over the phone. My wife had a similar operation and was OK after a few days as the proceedure is not a big one one (key hole surgery)
1	How do I create a formula in excel that multiplies a number by a percentage? You can get by with:\n"=A1 * 100"  (without quotes)\nThen set the cell format to Percentage.\n\nMany times, Excel will convert the number to percent if you choose that number formatting.  You can do this by clicking on Format | Cells and then select the Number tab.  Choose Percentage.  \n\nIt depends on how your spreadsheet is laid out, and without an example to look at, I can't give you a specific answer.  However, you can play around with:\n"=A1 * 100" \n"=A1 * 0.01"  \n\nDepending on your original number, that will probably give you the answer you need.  Play around with those.
8	where was the most embbarrasing place you farted? I had a '72 Ford Torino back in the day. I was out on a date with my future wife. We were sitting in the car talking, and I had to fart SO BAD. So I told her I had to go outside and get some "fresh air". I was stupid enough to sit on the hood of my car, and let 'er rip. Those old cars have solid metal hoods...well, the fart was strong enough to rattle the hood. I turned around and my wife was doubled over in the car laughing...quite embarrassing.
8	My husband will not give up porno, what do i do? It's both a sickness and an addiction (its also a sin). This can be as bad as alcoholism in some people. I suggest family counselling if you can afford it. Many pastors are trained as cuonsellers if you can't afford anything else. If he wont go, go yourself for support and advice. If you are a Christian don't forget to pray for him.

4	how to remove dulicate email address from mysql? Okay instead of how to remove duplicate email address, try not allowing people to insert duplicate email address.\n\nTo ensure that, you need to make the emailaddress field in the table as UNIQUE INDEX... Once you do, noone could insert the same email address...\n\nWhat you could do now to remove duplicate email address is do this...\n\nBut I don't know your table structure so it is gonna be assumptions now... \n\n- This will delete all entries that have a duplicate including the original\nDELETE FROM thistable \nWHERE count(emailaddress) > 1\n\n- To just delete the duplicate\nDELETE FROM thistable\nWHERE count(emailaddress) > 1\nORDER BY tableid DESC\nLIMIT 1\n\nWhat this does, it deletes every email address that duplicates where the tableid (primary key) is the newest and I just want 1 so the other will stay inside the database..\n\n\nI hope I helped..\n\nNOTICE: I wont be held responsible if anything goes bad...\nRemember to backup your database at all times when preforming the delete query...

0	Noah and the Flood? This link is a story from the National Geographic about the most updated scientific theory on how the story of Noah's Ark came to be.  I'm a Catholic Christian, so I don't interpret the Bible literally.  Therefore, this theory coincides with my faith easily, and I've accepted it as much as scientists have.  What about you?\n\nhttp://www.nationalgeographic.com/blacksea/ax/frame.html There is scientific proof that there was a large flood in Noah's part of the world. What I find interesting is that in an ancient manuscript, called "The Epic of Gilgamesh", the main character, aforementioned, spoke of a great flood, just like Noah's, and fleeing with his family and many animals in a boat.  What's even more interesting was that this manuscript was written 1500 years before Noah's account was written. \nThis just shows how a catastrophic event passed down, by word of mouth, to many generations. It's probably unlikely that a flood covered the entire earth, because when the Bible mentions the world, the actual known world at that time was a tiny spot in the Mesopotamia region.  That could have been flooded entirely, who knows?\nI am also Catholic...
0	Can an Atheist ACT Christlike, but not BE Christlike? Follow up from my earlier question, due to many of the answers being so different, it really made me think.  Even my "friend" who've I've been asking to give me better answers was able to give a though provoking answer.\n\nBut here is the follow up, and I guess to "itemize" the question,  While an Atheist can act Christlike - that is - loving, feeding the hungry, etc.,  Can an Atheist be Christlike, which would hinge on the spiritual "Christ is within me"?\n\nI think the previous question was terrific and got a plethora of good answers, so to the inspiration of the question, you've done well! Part of being Christlike is glorifying God.  So in that respect, no.\n\nChristianity contains moral instruction, but that's not all there is to it.  The most important aspect is having the heart and mind of Christ.  Someone Who was not just morally good, but involved in the help and growth of others (in a respectful way).\n\nI think it's relatively easy to be a good person just for the sake of being good if you were raised to think that way, or predisposed (personality wise) to be that way.\n\nIt's hard to get people who come from abusive or neglectful backgrounds to turn themselves around.  \n\nThink about the people Jesus hung out with and influenced.  They were not the people who had it all together or made the best choices.  Most were caught in sin and knew they were.  Those are the ones He came to heal and set free.\n\nFrom what I can glean from the answers I've read on the site, most atheists don't feel a need to be set free from anything, because they feel they are living good moral lives on their own.\n\nChristianity still is for, and appeals to, those of us who know we have a need for God.  Through Christianity we have the means to overcome hurts, neglect and addictions and as we mature, we are obligated and enabled to help others in need.\n\nI'm not saying that atheists never get in helping professions, but Christians are devoted to freely giving as we have been given no matter what career we choose.  I realize it doesn't always happen, but as we heal, we are to help others heal.\n\nIs it true that some people come to Christ and find that the healing process is too hard?  Sure.  Do some become interested in changing others before they've made the necessary changes in themselves?  Absolutely.  But misuse of any discipline is not proof that the discipline itself is flawed.

8	tell me this guys? i know my bf loves me a lot but isnt so expressive, but i am and he tells me that i shd do all the talking cuz thats the way he likes me better! But i wud like him to talk too, which he does but not always. While i wud certainly like him to tell me wat he feels abt this thing or the other, have talked to him about this, but he always replies that he just cant get expressive. His way of loving is subtle and mysterious, anyway, its good , but it also causes some misunderstanding, he cares  a lot, i know that but at times i feel since i talk more and he does it less, i feel i am like imposing myself on him. I feel, my god, is he actually liking wat i am saying or not? he never says he likes or doesnt. wat shd i do cuz wenever i feel this "imposing " thing, i hate myself and we fight over this thing then and things get bad. He is busy with studies and work and we as it is dont have time with each other, and wen he doesnt express himself properly, i get unsatisfied and angry, wat shd i do? just keep on talking. He isn't the only one who is queit. He is likely just enjoying hearing you talk. it sounds like he is really trying to show his love but he is having trouble putting it into your terms. if he is paying attention and especially looking you in your eyes, let it be.

2	Meditation or self hypnosis for anxiety? Which would be better to decrease my anxiety (just in general), meditation or sellf hypnosis. I've tried both but I usually wind up falling asleep!\n\nAlso does anyone konw of a good book on self hypnosis or meditation for phobias or generalized anxiety?\n\nJohnny B. Meditation and self-hypnosis tend to be different flavours of a very similar state. \n\nWith a structured outline for your session, self-hypnosis can be orchestrated by your conscious mind to actually achieve particular outcomes. Mainstream forms of Meditation tend to be focused on simply achieving a beneficial state that has a progressive and positive effect upon your levels of anxiety. \n\nIf you are looking at overcoming anxiety or phobias, then self-hypnosis is a far, far more applicable means of achieving this in my opinion and experience. \n\nI am of course deeply biased, but the best selling self-hypnosis book "The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing The Power of Your Unconscious Mind" is the best structured way to learn how to use it that I have encountered in 20 years of studying it. I am the author of that so let me give you some others too choose from too: \n\nThe Power of Your Subconscious Mind By Joseph Murphy.\nSelf-Hypnosis By Brian Alman.\nThrough The Open Door By Kevin Hogan.\n\nAll are great ways of learning more about how to communicate with your subconscious mind when you achieve self-hypnotic states.

9	Why do we have Eminent Domain? (what was the purpose of forming this law?)? The original idea was that if a public entity, such as a local city government, needed a piece of land, and the owner absolutely refused to sell, they could be forced to give it up at fair market value "for the common good."  Today, it is being most horribly abused, to condemn people's land so it can be used for commercial enterprises like shopping centers.  The Institute for Justice, which I think is www.ij.org, is on it.  This (and other Libertarian fights against injustice) matters so much to me that I've named the Institute for Justice as the contingent beneficiary in my will.  The fact that my estate is tiny is not the point; it's the thought that counts.  Besides, a hundred tiny estates could add up to a pretty fair chunk of money.

1	All the tadpoles died.  Why? Calmecita, they were doing fine in the pond yesterday, maybe 5-6 days after hatching.  Today I went out and I don't see any.  I don't have fish in there.  The water looks kind of greeny scummy today. Hi! Well, it _is_ normal for tadpoles to have high mortality rates. After all, only a few of the hundreds of eggs will finally grow into adult frogs or toads. Some are eaten by birds, some are parasitized or just die because they were not well developed.\nBut if it is a large enough pond, at least some tadpoles will grow normally. And remember what I said about the water (I left comments in the other question): if it is not at least partly renewed, the concentration of ammonia will rise too much.\n\nOh, and another thing. When they first hatch, the tadpoles still have a bit of yolk from the egg and do not feed; only after a few days they develop their horny beaks and start scraping the algae. So it might be that now they're staying closer to the bottom surface, and that's why they're less visible. \nI'm including a link to a site that shows the developmental stages for most tadpoles. The stages are numbered from 1 to 46, but the time it takes for the entire process to be completed depends on the species and also on environmental conditions: \nhttp://www.trentu.ca/biology/tadpole/Webstage2.htm\n\nTry to catch a few and see which stage they're at :-)\n-------------\nPS I've just read the last comment. What exactly is the "clarifier"? Tadpoles are very sensitive to chemicals, please don't add anything foreign to the water!

0	Can a seXy/holy meme establish itself because it contains a seXy circular self-referential argument? The sexy/holy circular self referential argument would go something like this:\n\nX is the one true meme. We know X is the one true meme because The Source of Universal Truth (or whatever) has approved X. \nWe know The Source of Universal Truth has approved X, because X contains statements which say so. \nWe know what X says is true because X is the one true meme. If it's dressed properly, yes it can become established.  If you put it out there in it's formal syllogistic format, you won't sell it.  Dress it up with flowery language and kill some people who doubt it every once in a while, and you grant it legitimacy.  Would that humans could always break things down logically and reject those things that don't meet the basic tenets of logical validity.  It saddens me that people are swayed by logical fallacies on a daily basis.\n\nOh, and I took that as an invitation to report abuse, so I reported you Wayknow T.  Have a nice day.

This advice is probably not worth a lot, but trading currencies is just like trading stocks, with the one big exception that you are doing it on 10% margin, so your gains and losses are magnified 10x. \n\nA trend once started tends to continue, so look for a trend and ride it. Is the currency trading above the 50 day and 200 day moving average? Is the currency at the bottom of the bollinger band? \n\nBe sure to cut your losses very quickly and let your winners ride. Even double up.

I could go without but he cant.  When we do have sex , even oral, I dread it & I watch the clock, counting down the minutes.  I havent feel aroused by him in some time.  Last time I felt aroused and interested in sex was with my best friend a month ago.  We didnt have sex but her & I kissed and made up for lost time & I look forward to being with her again.  Please dont say that I am gay and this is why.  I love having sex with my girl but I love men (only a man now that I am married).  I used to be a very sexual person in the past with other relationships with men (my girl is my only female I have been with).  Dont know what to do.  Not divorcing over this but need to work thru somehow. try telling your hus u need some time off ..maybe distance =will make the urge grow stronger
1	Which is the best telescope to purchase,what would be the best features to look for a first timer sky lover? I'd like to purchase a telescope for my 30 yr old son, would prefer quality, within a decent price range,we live in Arizona where the sky is always beautiful. He would be a first timer but he is educated, am I better off buying used? what accesories? Where can I go to research this type of item?I don't want plastic pieces, something he may be able to take with him totravel up in the mountains. thankyou for any advice you can share. MOMSRAGE4 There are lots of possibilities, depending on your son's interests, and what you consider a "decent" price range. A small dobsonian telescope is a good starter scope at a reasonable price (~$250 - $800). Meade Lightbridge dobs are built a bit better than the entry level ones and disassemble for better portability (~$500 - $1000).\n\nFor a more high-tech, computer controlled scope, the Meade LXD75 series (~$900 - $1400) is a good place to look. Various Schmidt-Cassegrains from Meade and Celestron ($1000 - $5000 & up) are another possibility.  Astromart is a good place for used scopes, as it's used mostly by serious amateurs. Avoid eBay unless you really know what you're looking for - a lot of junk there. \n\nThe links below are a few places to browse, plus the Yahoo telescopes group where you can find some informed opinions about astronomical equipment.

3	Who was the meanest teacher you ever had? I had an English teacher in the 8th grade who was a witch. She would punish the whole class if one kid was talking, and would have these materials checks, so if you forgot one pen, you get a zero out of ten points. Plus, she was sexist and racist. Somehow, she held a grudge against me and my friends for no reason. She would always pick on me and called me by last name instead of my first name like everyone else. Once, we had to write buisness letters, and my brother and I wrote to the same company. Even though the letters were different, we had to redo our letters, for partial credit. Without a doubt, my freshman year History teacher.  To start, he had more DUI's than anyone I know.  He was/is an alcoholic who took out his anger on the girls in the class - and it was always the girls.\n\nWe did a unit on slavery and for a full two weeks he informed the class that all the girls were slaves and that the boys could treat the girls horribly during class for that entire two week period.  Back then, we had to put up with it.  Nowadays, he wouldn't have a job.  The sad thing is he still does teach...
8	this question concerns differences in sexual preferences.? can a married couple stay together even if they both have different values when it comes to sex.  i like traditional sex, just nake sex with kissing:  my husband likes bondage hardcore.  he knows i hate his way, being tied up and all.  so to punish me he has withdrawn from sex with me altogether.  problem is it's been so long since we've had intercourse i don't care for it with him anymore.  i do not find him attractive anymore and don't know what to do.

8	Should I call him even though......? A guy at work is interested in me and vice versus.  He asked me for my number and I gave it too him.  He, in turn, gave me his number even though I didn't ask.  He's been hinting around for two weeks now for me to call him.  He hasn't bothered to call me.  Should I call him?  I'm not into calling guys until after I get to know them some.  Or should I wait.  I figure if he's interested enough, he'll call.  What do you think? I agree, if he's intersted he will call, but honey, its ok for women to break the mold and go for what they want.... If you find him attractive and you want to get to know more about him, Call him but make sure you make it completely slear that your not always going to make the first move and find out why he got your number if he wasnt going to use it? most likely he'll say something like he wasnt sure if you were feeling him and left the ball in your court... be alittle agressive and make that first move adn let him make all the next.
9	Who else supports the proposal to reinstate the Draft? I think it's a good idea. What do you think? Do us all a favor, stop thinking. You'll just hurt yourself. The whole point of a volunteer military is to make sure that the only people in it are the ones who want to be there. Draftees are a lot more likely to be unmotivated, unqualified, and just make bad soldiers in general. The last thing we need is a military made mostly of people who don't give a damn about their sworn duty.

2	could someone receive HIV/AIDS if....? critical thinking questions from my science textbook:\n\n... if a male that has already gone through puberty were to where an older cousin's underwear(who is not infected with HIV/AIDS)\n\n.... if a male that has already gone through puberty were to where a friend's underwear(that has already gone through puberty and is not infected with HIV/AIDS).\n\nwhat i think is that since there is no HIV/AIDS in the first place, nothing is transmitted?\n\nyour help is appreciated, thank you aids/hiv is transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids through the bloodstream.
8	Why is that the one you love does not love you and the one that loves you is the one you don't care for? People throw the word "love" around too loosely.  No one can love a person whom they do not know.  That is lust, not love.  If people would drop petty criteria such as height, weight, skin, hair and eye color, dress, flash and bling and look at how the object of their interest is treating them and others around them, they would experience true and lasting love.  When one knows the value and rarity of real love and appreciates it, then love can be returned to the one who deserves it.  One cannot receive or give what he or she cannot recognize and identify.

3	what type of pressures do bright students have in higher technical institutions and how to handle them? Studying in one of the prestigious technical institute and ranked 2 at present. Gets upset when he gets one less grade, but insists upon that he is not worried with grade, but not happy with the system. He is my son. Especially in higher institutions, the pressure to do well is HUGE (i'm at an ivy, and the competition is ridiculous).  I'd say just be there for your son, say that you're proud of him no matter what his grades are.  Also, perhaps try to put things in perspective for him.  such as "what do you think would happen if you weren't number 2?"  No one can be the best.  They can just do the best they can, be happy with what they accomplish, and learn and grow from every experience they have.  Also, suggest doing some sort of physical activities, that can ease a lot of stress, and put people in really good moods.  Eating well at school is very important too, to be awake and alert.  School can be very stressful, but just try to help your son realize that there are other things to enjoy in college, so much of it is about the social lessons you learn, too\n\nGood luck!
9	The secret behind America being the super power? I would appreciate if anti-Americans answer it. Agreed...many people hate America? But why is America a super power? What's the secret?\n\nBy the way, I am myself an anti-American, but I hate the government and I love the people in general. as an american, i think the secret behind america being a super power is that this status is an illusion.  the foundation underneath america's status as a super power is fragile and crumbling.  it's an image, nothing more.  an image that unfortunately likes to throw its weight around and hurt others who they don't like.  at my school we called that a bully and bully's ended up getting put on their butts and shown for what they really were.  america is having its time to bask in the glory, but i think that's fading fast.\n\nkinda like a person who parades themselves around as being rich and powerful but in reality are dirt poor, in serious debt and one slip up away from having the entire illusion yanked from underneath them.

Religions are pretty much anti logical by nature.  Its really impossible to pick a most logical religion without looking like a fool.\n\nThere are just to many factors when making the choice of what religion is the most logical to you it all depends on where you come from.  If you're truely looking for logic in religion I suggest you study math but even math isnt perfectly logical.

1	Does anyone know how to work out problems dealing with dalton's law of partial pressures? Please show how you do it!! I want to learn the process. There are 3 problems. Showing me how to do them, I am able to do the rest of the 40 problem worksheet. THANKS!!!\n1. A 250. mL sample of oxygen is collected over water at 25 degrees Celsius and 760.0  torr pressure. What is the pressure of the dry gas alone? (Vapor pressure of water at 25 degrees celsius = 23.8 torr)\n\n2. A mixture of 2.00 moles of H2 (2 is a superscript, meaning there is 2 hydrogen), 3.00 moles of NH3 (ammonia), 4.00 moles of CO2 (carbon dioxide) and 5.00 moles of N2 (nitrogen gas) exerts a total pressure of 800 torr. What is the partial pressure of each gas?\n\n3. The partial pressure of F2 (2 is a supersript) in a mixture of gases where the total pressure is 1.00 atm is 300. torr. What is the mole fraction of F2 2 is a superscript)?\n\nThank you very much, and please SHOW YOUR WORK!! Just Kidding! Just tell me how you got the answer, (the process, what formulas?) THANKS! The first step to solving these problems is knowing what Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures actually is.  The law states that the P(total)= P(1) + P(2) ... {with the items in parentheses in subscript}.\n\nFor #1, I know that the total pressure is 760.0 Torr.  I know that the water pressure at 25 degrees Celsius is 23.8 Torr.  So according to Dalton's Law, 760.0=23.8 + P(O2).  I know that P(O2) is the only pressure left because it is the only gas in the container.  So, with some subtraction, P(O2) = 736.  There are only 3 sig figs here, so don't add the .2.\n\nFor #2, I need to employ the theory of the mole fraction. The mole fraction is found for a particular substance in the container, and is found in the same ratio as partial pressures.  To find the mole fraction, take the number of moles of the substance and divide by the total number of moles in the container.  So, by knowing the mole fraction, I can then multiply that number by the total pressure to find the partial pressure.  I will do this for you for only H2.  The mole fraction for H2 is 2.00mol/14.0mol=.143.  .143*800= 114 Torr.\n\nFor #3, since the mole fraction is the same ration as the partial pressure fraction, take 300Torr/760Torr(1atm) = .395.  This is the mole fraction.\n\nThese problems become a lot easier when you remember Dalton's Law, and its applications through mole fractions.  Also, remember to keep the right number of sig figs.

If I were to put a snake in my childs crib and then blame my child for being bitten I would be reviled,and rightfully so. And isn't that essentially what God did by releasing Satan upon the world? He not only put the snake in the crib,he created the snake,which makes him personally responsible for all the evil in the world,so shouldn't he be reviled rather than revered?? Yep, god is responsible for all suffering and evil. The Bible even says that god created evil. Nice snake/Satan analogy.

8	ok, i have a boyfriend, Im really really happy with him but I wish I could have a best friend to hang out with The past 4 years I've been a loner, and I know I've missed out on alot and i barely have this boyfriend i go to college with and I feel happy, but he's a guy and I really wish I could have a friend to just hang out with, but gosh it's soo hard i only go to school 2 times a week!! Help? how can i make friend? or meet (hopefully) a best friend, or should i be happy with my boyfriend??? Help???????????? I would tell you that you should get involved in some school activities to meet people.  You think it's hard now, wait until later!  It gets even harder when you're out of school.  I can tell you from personal experience because I was with a guy of 8 years, we moved all around the country, and I lost touch with everyone I knew.  Now I'm back here in my home town and I'm lucky to have been able to hunt down 2 of my old friends.  I'm not with the guy I was with for 8 years anymore and I have no idea how and when I'll meet my next boyfriend because I don't know very many people.  \n\nMoral of the story.. make friends now, make GOOD friends, who are gonna be around for a long time. You have no idea how things will end up with your guy, if things don't work out and you have no friends to get you out of the house you'll be so miserable.  Just remember, it only gets harder as you get older to meet new people.  Do it now.  You'll be a better girlfriend for it, too, because you won't be relying on your guy to entertain you or go do such and such with you all the time.  That was an issue between my ex and I as the years passed, it was really hard on him.  It was hard on me, too.  I went shopping with my friends the other day and I realized how awesome it was to have someone to help me pick out clothes to buy and to run back and forth and grab different sizes for me so I didnt' have to keep going in and out of the dressing room.  Little things.  There are subjects that you just can't talk about w/ your guy, they dont' understand.  It's all about the little things and you will really appreciate having a friend around.  You can never have too many!

Can anyone give me some answers or give me a link to a site that might?  Thank you The previous answer was wrong. Nausea and fever won't kill someone, at least in the short term. The most important thing is rapid transport. Other items:\n1) universal precautions (it's contagious)\n2) oxygen, if needed\n3) IV fluids (don't delay transport)\n4) general supportive care\n5) unless the patient was elderly, or had known heart disease, a cardiac monitor wouldn't be needed\n\nThe window of treatment for bacterial meningitis is often a few hours. If treatment isn't started quickly enough, the patient won't survive. This is particularly true for young children.\n\nThe first responders (EMS, fire, police)will likely need to be treated with antibiotics.

So if people see angels doing G-D's work, and pray to these angels, would G-D not be please? Just like a math problem:there are many ways to get to the same correct answer. If saints and Jesus represent G-D's word, than why would G-D mind?   Please let me know what you guys think about this without the use of the 2nd commandment... We're never told to pray to anyone except to God. When the disciples asked Jesus to show them how to pray, He directed them to the Father. Not to angels or other beings. You're free to follow opinions but you're better off following the infallible word and example of Jesus. Who did Jesus always pray to? The Father.

In Texas there are two way in which you can prove an ‘informal’ marriage (which is what Texas calls a common-law marriage)\n\n1--a declaration of the marriage has been signed (yes, in Texas you can actually record a declaration of informal marriage with the county clerk)\n\nOR \n\n2--the man and woman agreed to be married and after the agreement they lived together in this state as husband and wife and there represented to others that they were married.\n\nSo have you AGREED to be married and REPRESENTED yourselves as married?  Just both of your names being on a loan does not mean you agreed to be married or you've held yourself out to be husband and wife.  Do you or have you referred to each other as husband and wife?  Have you filed your tax returns as 'married’?  \n\nIt sounds like you're still together.  If you intend to remain together then why not file the declaration of informal marriage?  Or just get married?
9	What do you think this sign mean? There was a sign we saw and just couldn't figure out what it meant, we were going to park there for a baseball game, but decided not to risk it.  The sign said:\n\nNo Parking (it was actually the P with a / through it)\nBallpark Events\n2 hours before/1 hour after\n\nLooking at it, I would guess it is saying that you cannot park there 2 hours before or 1 hour after a ballpark event.  What do you think?  Thanks in advance for your help! I would have to say the same thing. It probably means you can't park there 2 hours before a ballpark event or 1 hour after. Then again that doesn't make much sense. \n\nMaybe it means no parking UNTIL 2 hours before a ballpark event or 1 hour after. \n\nThats a trick sign.

8	what do u think of a long distance relationship ? If you are in a long distance relationship, it can be very trying.  If the couple can be honest and loyal- it could work, but it seems that distance can make a person think lying is a better option, because they figure "who will find out?"  Ultimately, the whole point of a relationship is to be together, so unless the couple commits to moving or something- I wouldnt recommend starting one up.  It can really mess you up.\n\nOn the other hand if you meet someone far away, it can give you a chance to get to know a lot about each other before you meet face to face- could be good, or bad.  BUT long distance relationships will never last, because togetherness is the goal. Unless thats the KIND of relationship you BOTH want. Eventually someone will have to move closer, or forget about it!  If you move closer together it isnt a long distance relationship anymore, so whether you get together or not- the "long distance" relationship has to eventually end. ;)

6	im 2 pretty to be mad? as you can se im 2 pretty 2 be mad at something dunb but i need 2 know hat yall think these girls is try 2 start stuff but im not worried about it but they kep going on and on n how we ran up and this girl and im like i didnt run up on no 1 and they be telling people that when they see us they are going to beat us up they saw me by myself numbers of times and they didnt say nothing i dont care but they keep running there mouth and i dony have time for it You are not stuck up and vain.  If that is truly your attitude about it, then you are pretty confident in yourself and it doesn't matter what anyone else says to you.  That is good that you are not afraid of them and you don't have time for their words.  How many teen girls really do what they say they're going to do?  Please, for some reason when they run their mouth to and about you it makes them feel good about themselves.  Even if you did do something mean to one of them, so what, look how they're acting.  Young girls are just trying to find their own identity and where they belong so that is why they feed off of the negativity, it makes them feel good about themselves.  It is so immature and unattractive.  Don't feed into it and don't allow them to make you afraid.  I know you probably aren't but I'm just saying be confident.  P.S. Remember how fustrating this is for you, in the future make sure you don't get caught up in the drama when their attention shifts to someone else.

I hear this argument from athesists, but can you think of other things that exist, that you cannot reach out and touch something tangible, like hatred, prejudice, etc.\n\nDogs hear what we can't, Bats see what we can't, and Bee's see a flower much differently than you and I...\n\nIf I have no valid "proof" of something, and my senses cannot detect it, is this by default a valid argument that it must not exist? What happens then, if the senses which we 'scientifically' use in this 'proof test' are in turn illusions of our mind and don't really exist?\n\nWhat is touch, sight, sound, taste and smell other than signals from our 'sense organs' going to the nerves and ultimately the brain - which is something man is yet to fully decipher?  Why then rely on these 'senses' as instruments to prove that something metaphysical exists or not?
5	^^^I can and can't^^^? I can play the cover drive, on drive, pull, hook, cut.......\nBut I can't play the sweep shot well. (i can play the slog sweep.)\nGIVE ME AN ADVICE PLEASE If you have good footwork, there is absolutely no need to play the sweep. \n\nLook closely, people who know exactly how to use their wrists to play the on drive, never use the sweep shot.\n\nMohd. Azharuddin rarely played the sweep. He had the "paddle sweep", which was directed behind the wicketkeeper. Never seen him play the orthodox sweep.\n\nSunny Gavaskar, the best player of the on-drive in the history of the game hardly played the sweep. Simply because, the sweep shot is for lesser mortals, who simply don't know to play down the leg side. And that includes Sachin Tendulkar. he does sweep, simply because his on-side play is simply isn't as good as the original little master.\n\nBut you are not Gavaskar or Azhar. So here's one link that should help you a lot:\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/1703662.stm\n\nRemember the key: there are straight-bat, on-side strokes that can be substituted for the sweep, with equivalent placement, power and a thousand-time-less risk. \n\nNext time you see a sweep, just let yourself know that the person playing it - even if it Lara himself, has a limited amount of ability on the leg side.
1	how does a venturi pump work? To produce vacuum, a venturi pump uses a transducer, which forces compressed air through a small opening into a venturi section. As air exits the opening, it expands, increasing in speed to supersonic velocity before entering the venturi section. This creates vacuum, or negative pressure, at the vacuum inlet port which is located between the opening and the venturi section.

6	Is the cost of common stock the rate of return stockholders require on the firm's common stock? True of False I think the best answer would be false.  The cost of common stock is the current fair market value of the stock as determined by the company's worth when taken into consideration along with the number of shares of common stock being traded.  What shareholders want the cost to be has nothing to do with the price of the stock.

5	Who thinks Dwayne Wade is nothing but a freethrow shooter? That is how they won these last games all he did was go to the line and his 42 points 21 of them were freethrow that sure does say something. To the Heat and mavs fans..  Its just a game, to the heat fans-congratulations, u got ur first title, enjoy the moment guys but dont brag, besides,its just ur first,and remember-"Be nice to the people on ur way up, because u will see them again on ur way down..."  \n\nAnd to the Mavs fans, like what avery said about dirk"He is a warrior,he tried..No excuses.." Yes the heat may have more phantom calls in this series than the entire NBA season but a win is a win.. The Mavs did have their chances too.. But knowing Mark Cuban, he and the Mavs will be back in the finals next season.. That is if the lakers dont acquire KG..  :)  because if they do, it will be the MIAMI HEAT VS LA LAKERS...

9	Why do Liberals try to insult me by implying Im gay? Strange, I thought liberals were open-minded and would never stoop to gay bashing. I mean to imply that being gay is bad by trying to insult me with it seems like quite a contradiction. So, liberals step up. How can you be for gay rights if you commonly insult people by saying theyre gay. I'm a liberal.  I don't do that to people.  It's mean to insult people for being who they are.  Maybe the people you're referring to aren't necessarily liberals, maybe they're just jerks.

I DON'T HAvE MONEY TO PAY FOR my wifes BIRTH CAN I APPLY FOR AN EMERGANCY MEDICAIDE If you're going to a hospital that receives federal funding, they are legally obligated to provide emergency services whether or not you can pay.  The social worker at the hospital should be able to tell you what payment plans are available to you.  The important thing is to get your wife to a hospital right away when the contractions start. Pack a suitcase with a few days' worth of clothing for her and basic hygiene supplies.  Keep it by the door, ready to go.  If you really can't afford a hospital, you might be able to find a licensed midwife who will deliver the baby at home.

2	Why do we tremble when having a cold? I have a not so severe cold meaning i get runny nose once in a while but i do see to be cold at times n hot at other times, y is this happening?? is a way for the body to fight off infections?? or am i just understanding this all wrong!! While some of the above answers have slight truths to them…these are the anatomic (real medical) reasons why this happens.  Everything you described happens because when you get an infection, our body naturally tries to fight it off.  \n\nWhen we get a fever our bodies try to kill the infection by turning up our internal temperature.  Bacteria and viruses cannot live at high temps and are killed by our fever.  This is when we feel hot.  \n\nOur bodies respond by shivering to raise the temperature. Shivering produces heat in the body. Once the temperature goes up, we start to feel warm. When the fever goes away, that is when we sweat\n\nYou get a runny nose, because your body decides to make extra mucus in order to “wash” away any bacteria that could get trapped in your sinuses.\n\nI hoped that helped...I tried to get to the point and not be so “wordy”

Some noted rights include:\n\nRight to Remain Silent\nRight to Seek Counsel\nRight to Waiver\nRight to Refrain from Self-Incrimination\nRight to Mistrial and Appeal\nRight to Object\n\nRights do not change, only the proceedings, which are done often in a magistrate format with a presiding officer judge--depending on the offense.

Will time limits force the Iraqi people to become self reliant quicker?  If not, why? setting time limits for poor people is one thing, getting politicians to do anything is another.

6	Most of the animation Companies Wanting Experienced guy in 3d MAX  what will do freshers for earning in 3d Max i'm not exactly sure what your question is, but i think it means if you're new to 3d how do you get a job when companies only ask for people with experience. well the best way is to just get your demo reel looking awesome. put heaps of errort into it. then i would honestly just approach companies. most companies do not advertise for Junior positions. just knock on their door, get them to look at your demo reel. even if they are not hiring right there and then they will keep your demo reel on file if its good. if they dont have any work they may tell you how you can improve your demo reel, they may also know of another place that is hiring juniors.\n\nso by best piece of advise is work on ya demo reel and then just show up on the door step of the companies you want to work for. BE PREPAIRED do some research on the company before you go there. like what they recenetly finished, what they are working on right now. these can be found on the company's website\n\nhope this helps\n\neagle4

3	how do you write a good outline for a social studies research project? it has to do w/ the Edo period.... and i don't know how to start... :( First, the Edo period is a huge subject so narrow it down to the main points you are talking about.  Depending on the length of the project, each of those points will be your sections or main paragraphs.  Label those with nice fat Roman numerals.  Then chunk each point down and label them A, B, C...\n\nFor example:\n\nEdo Period Japan\nI.   Social Structure\n       A.  Social Class\n       B.  Political Structure\nII.  Art\n       A.  Theater\n       B.  Painting\nIII. Religion\n       A. Shinto\n       B. Buddhism\n       C. Merging of Shinto & Buddhism\n\nConclusion.\n\n\nThis is a rough outline that could be really edited because its way too general and it isn't very apparent how each point/section relates to one another.  Good luck with you own.
2	Can a STD stop a woman from having babies? Yes, a STD can stop you from getting pregnant thats why it is so important for sexually active women to get regular gynocological check ups because a woman could have an STD like chlamydia or gonnoreah and not even know it and this if left untreated will led to pelvic inflammatory disease which can cause women to become infertile. Therefore, when you visit your gynocologist not only do you need to ask for a pap smear but, you should let him/her know that you are sexually active and want to be tested for STDs there is nothin to be embaressed about when it comes to your health this should be a top priority and remember to always practice safe sex or better yet abstinence.
0	Why do christians, and other religious people to a lesser extent, constantly shove their beliefs in ones face? I am an atheiest and have no desire to hear about how 'god' is going to strike me down for saying such a thing. Because they have forgotten the fact that according to their religion, God is the only one who needs to worry about other people believing.\n\nI am also an atheist. I have no problem with people practicing religion, or even talking about religion- but when people tell me that I'm wrong, I get pretty angry. Even if I am wrong, and God does exist, I'm going to hell and you're not going to have to deal with me when you're all the way up in heaven.\n\nSome atheists are guilty of that too, though, and it pisses me off just as badly. Live and let live.
0	What is "ANG DATING DAAN" mean .... ? well, according to Angdatingdaan.org it means (The Old Path) and it refers to "a Bible Exposition on-air program by the Philippine-based religious organization, MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF GOD INTERNATIONAL."\n\nI don't know anything more about this organization than what I've read on their website, but I would be very wary of them.  On their basic doctrines page, they say, Jesus Christ, a true and Mighty god.  But they don't say The true and  Mighty God.  They talk about God the Father, but I could find no mention of the Holy spirit.\n\nThis website is critical of Bro. Soriano, the leader of the organization.  If it's accurate, it would indicate serious problems with this teacher.  The most notable...\n\n"One of his controversial doctrines is that there is something impossible with God: that it is impossible for God to lie. God does not know everything, either, because if he did, says Soriano, he would have known that Lucifer would turn into a rebel and therefore wouldn’t have created him in the first place."  \nhttp://www.inq7.net/nwsbrk/2002/apr/15/nbk_3-1.htm

2	I am seeing a doctor but anyone ever had this problem? I have been having chest pains at stressful times. I am 28 yrs old and 250. not huge but alittle overweight. I am able to run and jog,exercise. However, my blood pressure has risen alittle over the past year(i am on medication now). I have seen a doctor who has ran test including stress test,check of esophigus,die in the veins,heart echo and all showed nothing. Is it in my head or possible panic attacks? I experienced it.\nMy heart is also pounding during the stressful times. The stress test results negative.  Thank God for that.\n\nMy doctor also thought it's panic attack.\nIf you drink coffee, you should cut down a little bit. This is the advice from my doctor and now I'm drinking decaf. It also help walking away from whatever you're doing from time to time to get some fresh air. Last, learn how to relax such as meditation.

Official Pentagon footage...\nhttp://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/foi/index.html#911video Yes I saw the nose of the plane for a split second at the right of the frame 1:26 and then the explosion.\n\nAs garlic said, the plans was cruising pretty quickly.  At 600 mph it covers about 900 feet per second.  This camera looks like it captures a frame every second or two, so it stands to reason we could only pick up a quick glimpse of it.\n\nHmmm... looking at the video again, the nose looks pretty small for a commercial airplane.  As for clothes etc. flying in the air, that could have easily been done after the fact.\n\nAfter watching that other video, here is the link in total:\n\nhttp://www.pentagonstrike.co.uk/flash.htm#Main\n\nand seeing the perfectness of the hole, I wonder...\n\nI will only wonder 'cause I am scared Dick Cheney will shoot me in the face if I think too much about it.\n\nLet's face it folks, this war was all about paying back the guys who made it so Bush got "elected" twice.  By the way, nice job by the voters getting scared by the last-minute bin Laden video.  This time in history will be remembered with embarrassment at how easily manipulated the public is, ironically at a time when we are the most connected and should be the most informed in the history of the world.\n\nOne last thing, they won't "find" bin Laden unless it is in their best interest to do so.  Public safety is not their best interest.  Making themselves flithy rich is their best interest.

8	Seeking advice on relationship? I'am at a verge of breaking up with my college sweetheart and the only woman I ever loved in my life. She was my love during four years of college, and we kept talking to each other every week over the phone from last two years and met occasionally ( as I moved to a different country ), every time we met I loved her company and hated to let her go. \n\nShe madly loves me and wants a final answer from me about marriage.Problem with me is although I love her, every time she is not with me I feel the urge to run after other women, it makes me happy, and brings me up if I feel down.\n\nIt's a long realtionship, we both have been through alot, and understand each other, I feel at peace with her. Is the urge to meet diff. women and fear that I might start liking someone else in her absence, worthy enough to let a thing so precious slip away ? I don't mean to be mean but, if you really LOVE her let her go because your going to hurt her.  This poor woman is in love with you and wants ONLY you.  You on the other hand can only love yourself.  If you want to make this work you need to think with your heart and brain and not your D I C K.  Please make up your mind and keep it in your pants if you want to be with her.  Oh yeah and make sure she knows that your with god knows how many other woman so she can go get her self an STD test.   Grow up, use the college education you are paying for, stop looking for sympathy from everyone out here, and start being a man not a little spoiled boy.  When your selfish choices start hurting a good person it makes you a loser.

6	How do i enrich my walk with Christ in the face of problems? That's the best time to do it!  (In fact, I'm told that persecuted Christians in other countries are actually praying that Americans will begin to face persecution.  They are praying this out of love because they know that in hard times, this is when we lean on God the most).\nWhen we feel secure in our own ability to handle life, the human instinct is to leave God on a shelf in our own minds.  However, when hard times come, we realize that we are fragile humans in need of a loving, all-powerful God - our Father.  He is always quick to draw near us, just as we would while teaching a young child to walk when it appears that they are about to fall.\nMy advice: find a quiet place & a good praise CD.  Pop it in, and enter into His presence with thanksgiving in your heart.  Enter His courts with praise.  Once you have entered into a spirit of worship, begin to read the Bible, or you could simply sit quietly, and wait to hear from God.  (Prayer isn't always an act of speaking - the best prayers are often the act of listening).\nLean on His guidance, and He will direct your paths.  You are NOT alone!  God bless.
0	Are the Ahmadi Muslims believe that Jesus got buried in Kashmir? and if they believe so, then is that mean they disbelieve what God told them in the Quran?\n\nExplanation of Quran Ch 4\n\n[157] And because of their saying (in boast), "We killed Messiah 'Isâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of Allâh," - but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it seems to them it happend (the resemblance of 'Isâ (Jesus) was put over another man and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. and they didn't kill him for sure"\n\n[158] But Allâh raised him up (with his body and soul) unto Himself And Allâh is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise. \n\n[159] And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), but must believe in him (as human massenger), before his death And on the Day of Resurrection, will be a witness against them. Yes.\nAhmadi Muslim (about 200 million worldwide) believe that Jesus was a humanbeing, a prophet of God Almighty. lived a human life ,died a human death inKashmir India where he tarried in search of the " lost sheep of the Tribes of Israel."\nJesus Son of Mary: Islamic Beliefs\nHis Virgin Birth \nMessenger to Israelites \nProphet of God \nMiracles of Jesus \nSurvival from Crucifixion \nMigration to India \nNatural Death \nJesus in Islam\nIslam is a religion which requires belief in not only the Prophethood of Muhammad but all the prophets of God, including Jesus (Qur'an 2:137).\nThe Holy book of Islam, the Quran, relates in detail the story of Jesus, including his birth, mission as a Prophet to the Israelites, and his crucifixion. Muslims believe that this story is in harmony with the Bible too. Indeed, a whole chapter in the Qur'an is named after the mother of Jesus (Chapter 19 - Maryam).\n\nBirth of Jesus\nIn Islam, Mary is described as a pious and righteous woman who symbolizes righteous believers blessed with Divine inspiration. Islam then affirms the fatherless birth of Jesus and rejects outright the opposing claim that his birth was illegitimate. \n\nWhereas, Islam recognizes the virgin birth of Jesus as a miraculous event, it does not consider it unnatural; the laws of nature are never broken. It just reflects the inability of man to fully understand the science behind various phenomena observed in nature. Numerous scientists have explained the virgin births. \n\nIn Islam, the immaculate conception of Jesus is not interpreted to mean that he was in some way a Divine Being. He was still a human being (Qur'an 19:31). \n\nDivinity of Jesus\nIslam presents Jesus as a human who believed in the absolute Unity and Indivisibility of God (Qur'an 3:52). \n\nMuslims consider the doctrine of Divinity of Jesus and Trinity as later changes to the teachings of Jesus. The New Testament itself furnishes abundant evidence to show that Jesus was only a human being whom God chose for the reformation of His people, and repeatedly contradicts the Divinity of Jesus. Jesus always referred to himself as having been sent by God (John 17:3) and his followers, too, considered him a man approved by God (Qur'an 19:37; Acts 2:22, John 3:2). \n\nHe was undoubtedly called the son of God, but this title has only been employed metaphorically and in fact is used for all the chosen ones of God (Matt 5:9, Exodus 4:22). The literal connotation of 'son of God' as a Divine Being and hence the subsequent development of Trinity Dogma was the result of Hellenistic influences on Christianity as it spread in the Gentile world. The Semitic usage of 'son of God' was misunderstood and forgotten and disputes about the exact status of Jesus erupted, as recorded in the early Church history. \n\nJesus prayed to God like all other God-fearing individuals (Luke 5:16), and engaged in spiritual exercises such as fasting (Matt 4:2). Furthermore, Jesus lacked knowledge of the future (Mark 13:32), as only the Divine Being possesses perfect and complete knowledge. \n\nMission of Jesus\nThe mission of Jesus was confined to the Children of Israel (Qur'an 3:50, Matt. 10:5-6; 15:24). He was commissioned by God to revive the true spirit of the Torah in the hearts of the Israelites and clear any misunderstandings about the Law. He purified and revitalized Judaism. As Jesus was a follower of Moses, he did not change or reject the Mosaic Law. He had come to fulfill the Law (Matt 5:17). \n\nMiracles of Jesus\nThe Holy Qur'an mentions several miracles of Jesus, including his ability to create birds, his ability to cure the leprous and the blind, and raising the dead to life. The ability to create birds is a metaphor meaning ordinary people who accepted the teachings of Jesus were spiritually transformed into birds soaring high into the lofty regions of the spiritual firmament above all worldly concerns. The healing powers can also be un
9	Is this a permissible remedy under Title VII? The Union at ABC company has not permitted African Americans to become a part of its ranks because of opposition from union members. African American employees win when they sue to join the union. The court orders appropriate remedies. The union still resists African American as members. Eventually the court orders that the union admit a certain number of African Americans by a certain time or be held in contempt of court. The union is mandated to obey the court order to accept African-Americans otherwise it will be held in contempt.  Employees of ABC Company with the status of rank and file must all be admitted as union members no matter to what racial group they belong.  It is equality under the law.

3	Do you say, "broken at the waist" or "broken by the waist"? Thanks in advance. Simple question for English native speakers. It would depend on the sense in which you were using it. It's not a common expression in English.  If you were describing the way a garment looked, say, a long white dress, broken at the waist by a pink sash.  If you were speaking of a  vessel, such as a vase, which was damaged at the narrowest point, it could be broken at the waist. It would not be used either way to describe  an anatomical break, I don't think. \nThe only way you could use "by the waist " would be to explain a shape altered by the waist.

That is why I believe in God.

I am sure the desire is there, either squandered or put into others. What would be a remedy for this? Guys need to keep the romance up.  Once you are married, it's like the game's over and all the chasing and passion and romance fall away to the real world.  Keep the passion alive like when they were dating.  Also, I heard on the radio this morning that it's frequently because women feel unattractive, so men need to let their wives know they are still hot and that they still desire their wives and it's not just something they want to do and get over with.  Oh and obviously it has to be passionate, and something the woman will enjoy.  If it's just going to be fast and routine with no foreplay, any woman would rather pass.
1	what chemical makes transitions lenses work? i was wondering how easy it would be t9o manipulate the intensity of the material at will if anyone is willing to share info plz help There are certain kinds of transition lenses nowadays that don't depend on the chemical that the lens is soaked in. They used to call this photo white photo black, for its ability to turn clear and dark under different light conditions. What happens is when light impacts the molecules that make up the lens itself, causing it to become excited at the atomic level. When this happens you have electrons jumping from a ground state to an excited state, and the resultant photon given off is of a certain energy level, which will explain why we even have a choice of colour for our transition lenses. This is largely based on the electromagnetic spectrum. When we go back into a room there is not enough light to continually maintain the higher energy quantization of the atom and it reverts back to its original ground state, a.k.a unexcited state, and it ends up clear.

9	Will the eating of meat become illegal in the future? Meat  requires so much land and other resources to produce and farts are a major cause of global warming too. also, it's cruel. 100 years  ago women and black people had few rights in America. Won't animals have more rights in the future too.?\nWhen there are enough enlightened people to bring about change in the laws. Well, Maby.... I hope so... for the animals sake, but meat is protein and if we dont eat meat then we have to eat something else that contains protein.Meat makes people fat though, eehh. I'm so going on a diet =/

4	HP OfficeJet7110 won't print even after replacing new ink cart. /now has one "cyan" prhd prob. still won't prt I bought this 2nd hand from office supply store (used in store only) and have already put more parts into it (pwr. mod./pwr.cord. col.& blk. ink cart.) all for about $75 and am hesitant to add more. It cycles through after install. software etc. like it will print but flashes (bad printhead/replace cyan) and even with that will print nothing....The paper comes out with no ink. If anyone knows if this is worth adding the cyan prthd, I'll be glad to do that, but I was thinking that it should be printing the black ink at this point unless it needs cleaning, etc. Any solutions for cleaning, repair, salvaging this problem are deeply appreciated. THANKS!! hello again.  thank you for choosing my previous answer as 'best answer'.  so sorry to hear you are still having problems.\n\ni, too would recommend replacing the cyan printhead.  it should run no more than $34.  Item number is HP c4921a.  Some printer units out there usually do not print ANYTHING if there carts/printheads are bad.  but they usually refuse to move at all.\nto replace the machine with the updated one would run you about $200.- $250.  so you need 2 decide if you want 2 put more in2 this 1, or scrap the idea and get a new 1.  i'd hate to see you be only $34 away from having the printer work flawlessly, and on the other hand, you don't want 2 nickle and dime you in2 the $200. price where you could have gotten a brand new one.\ndouble check with HP, i think they can be a great asset.  i think they also have a buy back program, where they will buy your old machine back.  they only give $50, but i'm not sure if this is limited to handheld units or not.\ngood luck - have fun!! - hope this helps.
8	Confused about Boyfriend? Ok, so the guy I've been talking to for the past 3 and a half months on myspace/net/phone is now my boyfriend - we met and went out to see a movie a couple times and we get on well.\nI know he obviously likes me alot, to talk to me for nearly 4months and take the time out to get to know my personality, but now he is asking about the sexual side of things. \n\nRecently he asked when I would be ready to have sex, (were both virgins -hes 20 I'm 19) I said I didn't know only because I like him so much and don't want to tell him I want to wait until I'm married.\n\nThe thing that makes it confusing is that he's not rushing me- if he was it would be simple -dump him- but he just wants to know it will be in he near future and not 'never'. But I don't see us getting married(anytime soon), and I'm scared he will go somewhere else or if I tell him, he might freak out and think I want to marry him or something.\n\nHelp please, What exactly should I say? Should I tell him in person? From a guys point of view, I would say to tell him the truth and don't hold back anything.  Anything not told will eventually end up hurting the both of you.  Depending on how he accepts the facts you tell him, will determine whether there is a future for you two.  Telling in person is better because you can tell if that person is lying or how he accepts the news by body language.

0	Do demons have the ability to hurt us? Isn't it said in the Bible that God has to grant evil beings (specifically Satan in the passaeg I'm thinking of) permission to hurt or torment us? When one complies with the counsel of God's Word regarding spiritism, you spurn the bait of the demons. (Compare Psalm 141:9,10; Romans 12:9.) Does this mean that wicked spirits will stop trying to capture you? By no means! After tempting Jesus three times, Satan (the chief of the demons) "retired from him until another convenient time."\nLuke 4:13) Similarly, obstinate spirits not only ATTRACT people but also ATTACK them.\n\n\nRecall Satan's attack on God's servant Job.  The Devil caused the loss of his livestock and the death of most of his servants.  Satan even killed Job's children. Next, he struck Job himself with a painful disease.  But Job kept his integrity to God and was greatly blessed.  (Job 1:7-19; chap. 2:7,8 & chap 42:12) Since then, the demons have made some people speechless or blind and have continued to revel in the suffering of humans.  (Matthew 9:32,33; 12:22; Mark 5:2-5) Today, reports show that demons sexually harass some and drive others to insanity.  They incite still others to murder and suicide, which are sins against God. (Deuteronomy 5:17; 1 John 3:15) Nonetheless, thousands of people once ensnared by these wicked spirits have been able to break free.  How has this been possible for them? They have done so by taking these vital steps. Even  if you have not practiced spiritism , get rid of anytghing having spiritistic uses or overtones.  This includes books, magazines, videos, posters, musical recordings and objects used for spiritistic purposes. Also included are idols, amulets and other items worn for protection and gifts received from practicers of spiritism. (Deuteronomy 78:25,26; 1 Corinthians 10:21). We can be successful in our spiritual warfare against the Devil and the demons under his direction.  There is no reason to quake in fear of Satan, for the disciple James wrote: "SUBJECT YUOURSELVES...TO GOD; BUT OPPOSE THE DEVIL, AND HE WILL FLEE FROM YOU."  James 4:7. So go on the offensive in opposing Satan by having nothing to do with occult or magical practices and those indulging in them.  \nThe Scriptures clearly show that servants of God must refuse to look for omens or to engage in astrology (horoscrope reading included) divination, etc.  If we are spiritually active and strong in true worship we need not be afraid that someone will cast a spell on us.  Numbers 23:23; Deuteronomy 18:10-12; Isaiah 47:12-15; Acts 19:18-20. \n\nFirst century Christians in Ephesis who had practiced spiritism before becoming believers took positive steps.  We read that "quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody." (Acts 19:19)\n\nWe know that the Devil fled when Jesus resisted his attack by using the Scriptures during the temptation in the wilderness. (Matthew 4:4,7,10, 11. Putting on the complete suit of God-given spiritual armor makes a difference.

4	The dangers of unplugging your computer? So what exactly is the problem if you just unplug your computer before turnnig it off (besides obviously losing all unsaved stuff)? There shouldn't be any additional problem. If you unplug the system while it's running, the hardware won't be affected. The only hardware that could have a problem would be anything that's moving like disk drives. The drives are set up so that if the electricity is removed, the heads back away from the platters.\n\nSo other than the potential for data loss through incomplete writes or corruption, you should have no hardware issues.
2	Please Answer This...? I'm 12, 5'4 1/2", and 145 lbs. Is that fat?! Cos seriously, i feel huge and this is an incredible downfall on my self-esteem. I won't go anywhere without a hoodie or baggy jeans on. I've been eating smaller portions and exercising for an hour 5 days a week, and i've lost 5 lbs. Am i still fat? Please speak to your doctor, or to your school nurse if you cannot get your parents to make a doctor's appointment for you.  You are on the right path with the smaller portions & exercise, good for you! Be sure that you are eating meals that are well-balanced, too, not just less food. At your age, believe it or not, your body still requires somewhere in the neighborhood of at least 1600 calories a day (that is an approximate minimum). Keep in mind that as you begin to lose weight, some of the weight will be retained water, especially if you drink lots of soda and eat lots of salty stuff; but weight loss at your age should be supervised by a medical professional, and whatever you lose or don't lose, DO NOT become obsessed by your weight/body image.  It really is true, the outside is not as important as the inside.  I'm not just spouting spiel, my daughter was borderline anorexic and down to 90 lbs (she's 5'6")before I realized what was going on as she does not run around less than fully dressed.  It's pretty scary and a real eye-opener. If you want to see what can happen, go to Entertainment Tonight's website and search for pics of "the anorexic bride"; she is supposed to be on Dr. Phil's show tomorrow as well.  Take good care of yourself, sweetie, we'll all be praying for you.

9	what were some Communsit threats that happend in the US during the 1920? If you are talkng about the COMINTERN of 1919, it refers to a doctrine to export Communism around the world, but I am not aware the US had any threats to its national security from the Soviets.  We were more in danger of revolution stemimg from the abject misery brought on by the depression.\n\nGranted Atty General Palmer began a round of expelling European immagrants and arresting anarchists, liberals, \nsocial reformists and labor organizers in the Palmer Raids\nbut... I suppose the biggest threat to the US from communists was ...fear that lead to a number of domestic injustices.  Not unlike what is happening today.

9	Why do we blame George Bush for so much? It shows the rest of the world how disrespectful our country is when we place blame on one man the leader of our country even if you dont agree with him should you bash him and have such little respect for someone who clearly is only human trying to do what he and millions of others (ones who voted for him) think is right. Because people are selfish and not open-minded. Unstead of trying to do things to get more knowledgable, such as doing research, contacting politicians, etc, they just listen to what the media says or what someone else's opinions are, and then they make their opinions the same. Also, when things don't go people's ways, or when usual things are disrrupted, they blame the President. Case in point, the gas prices. Bush doesn't control if the prices go up or down, but as stated above, people base things on what they hear or read, instead of making their own opinion.

5	do you think that trading T.O to the cowboys was a good idea? First of all, he was signed to a free-agent deal; he wasn't traded. Second, being a huge Cowboy fan, I think that signing him was a good idea. Andy Reid is too soft to handle players like Owens. Look at Keyshawn Johnson. When he left the NY Jets and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he left on bad notes. When he came to the Cowboys, he uttered little word under the direction of the drill sergeant of the NFL, Bill Parcells. Parcells knows how to control outspoken players like Johnson and Owens. Just wait until football season starts.

3	what foods do egypt eat? its for a homework Because Egypt was very dry, and relied mostly on the Nile River to water the crops, the Egyptians could only grow certain kinds of food. Mainly they grew wheat and barley. \n\nThe Egyptians made the wheat into bread and into soup and porridge, and they also added hops to make the barley into beer. In fact, some people think the real reason that the Egyptians first began growing grain was to make beer. This is an Egyptian model of beer jars (from the Louvre), which the Egyptians made to put in your grave when you died so you would have beer in the next world.\n\n(from the Louvre, Paris, France)\nThe Egyptians also ate meat. You could go to a butcher shop and buy meat there, just as people do today. Only because it rarely rains in Egypt, they could have the meat outside in the courtyard of the store instead of inside. Here is a model of a butcher shop, also from somebody's grave. Can you see the different cuts of meat all laid out? At the very bottom there is a whole leg of mutton.\nBut the Egyptians would not eat pigs (bacon or ham or pork or salami) because they thought pigs carried leprosy. They ate beef and mutton and duck and goose. \nFor dessert, the Egyptians liked to eat dates. This is a picture of some real Egyptian dates which were put into somebody's grave for them to eat in the next world, and which were preserved in the dry climate for three thousand years until archaeologists dug them up again.\nArchaeologists have also found seeds which show that the Egyptians grew watermelons, and other kinds of melon.

9	Republicans and Democrats....? Please explain, if you are either, why you can't stand the other party (if you feel that way).  I am and have always been an Independent. I don't care for Bush but I can't say that I agree 100% with either side on every issue.  I think it would be great if we were all just Independent because there would be so much less fighting, don't you think? I mean fighting amongst ourselves in the U.S.   This way the country could vote for the person they pick no matter what party he/she is as President instead of FEELING they HAVE to vote Rep. or Dem.  There have been fights w/people at work that almost to punching over political party (not me). This is why my parents NEVER shared their political views. I understand now -- and I'm over 40. Marie,\nI WISH in the real world it were possible to have things the way you say.  But I think that even if people were all independent, that would not change how people feel about the two extreme worldviews of liberals/conservatives and this splits the parties more than anything.  The way that liberals in this country have gotten portrayed by conservatives (who support big business and are against most if not all social programs, except the ones for the war machine and business), is so distorted I don't even recognize them.  I've never in my 65 yrs. met a liberal like the misguided, simple-minded ones they discribe.  But I have met plenty of conservative, esp. Repubs (but Dems too) who are almost living stereotypes of a simple-minded, rigid anti-people (unless you're rich or aspiring ) conservatives.\n\nI think the way you're thinking is like being in a fantasy world.  It's a nice idea but people who are independents generally aren't in the fray.  I don't believe their voice is heard so they have little to no effect.  Females especially have been socialized to be peacemakers and I think more men should be and more women shouldn't be afraid to stand up and fight for things they care about.   Women's issues, peace, helping people who are disabled, poor, elderly instead of helping the rich get richer which has been happening in a terrible degree are moral values that I think are worth fighting for.\nSwitzerland was neutral in WWII and that was, almost everyone agrees, worth fighting in.  Being independent is like that.  I like what Mark Twain said.  He said he believed in the two-party system, that's why he was a Democrat, implying that at least two parties existed WITHIN the party.  If you study the parties, there ARE big differences in them and I think the DEMOCRATIC PARTY in spite of its craziness is a better representative of the best of AMERICA.

She just had enough to fill the "cup" of a flat champagne glass.

I was at work the other day and felt somthing go in my eye i believe i got it out when i flushed my eye with water there at work but my eye has been irratated ever since constantly watering. I cannot fell anything in my eye so is it possible that i may have a scratch on my eye? and if so what can i do to reduce the soreness? the only sure way to find out is to see an eye doctor.  it's only human nature to rub when things irratate our eyes & if something was in it you may well have scratched it.  if the object is still in your eye you will need an eye doctor to find & remove it.  if the eye is scratched, there are special drops that relieve your pain.

4	Mac OS Question? In Mac OS X is there a utility that automatically turns on/off dashboard or expose based on which application is running For example, usually I have my 3rd mouse button set to do Expose and my 4th mouse button set to do Dashboard but when I run certain apps I'd like to have those mouse buttons go back to normal and not be mapped to expose and dashboard. It'd be nice to not have to open the mouse system preferences every time and instead have some utility detect that I've launched that particular app and disable. Check out your mouse's software to see if you can customize it per application. \n\nOr you can get USB Overdrive http://macupdate.com/info.php/id/7115 and it will let you customize mouse buttons per application.

Castration is the most effective way to "cut off" your testosterone levels, but be warned, your pants are going to fit funny afterwards.  There once was a man who had three weiners, and his pants fit him like a glove, but that's another story...\n\nOK, seriously, what's wrong with morning wood?  Nothing says "I'M ALIVE!" like sporting a full-on chubby.  You should embrace your manhood rather than run from it.\n\nAs for the Hairloss problem, talk to your Doctor about going on Propecia.  Must be prescribed, but for most people It really works.  The sooner you start taking it, the less hair you will lose.  But understand that it is not cheap, and if you ever stop taking it, your hair will start falling out again.
7	Why does your singing voice change when you become older? As I have become older my singing voice seems to be changing. I can't seem to sing higher than i used to why is that Changes in the singing voice are caused by physical changes in the larynx. At puberty, your body is growing and the increase in the size of your larynx causes the first voice change. As you age further, the vocal folds (which are mere folds in the muscle, not chords as so many people believe) grow looser, making it more difficult to hit those high notes.

5	In tennis what is called when you hit the net of a serve and it goes it? In tennis what is called when you hit the net of a serve and it goes it?\nis it a let? or a net? what about when like a ball rolls on your count from a different sourt during a point? is that a let? It's called a let. When a let occurs, the serve is redone. If the server is on their first serve and they get a let, they redo their first serve. That is why some players say "take two" when the server hits a let. The same with the second serve. But if the ball hits the net and goes out, it counts as a fault.

9	Read this question carefully? What is worse?\na)The President knowingly sells control over six important ports to a company based in Emirates Arab United.  Read that sentence again, I'll wait....\nb)The President claims that he didn't know about the deal that sold control over six ports to an arab company, until after it was consumated.  Yet, he defends the deal anyway.\n\nOk, Now choose:\nIs he irresponsible and greedy\nor, dumb and out of the loop. His office is legally responsible for doing an in-depth security review of all major company sales by foreign businesses.  They review the deals to ensure there are no legal or security concerns before the deal is allowed to go through.  If they run into any concerns they can take steps to mitigate the risks (such as ensuring no one will be placed into sensitive areas, background checks, rescoping the contract, etc...)  This is naturally done in private since we are talking about security concerns and big business deals that can affect the stock of said companies.\n\nIt is possible that his staff reviewed the deal and gave the go-ahead without his direct involvement and he is merely saying he trusts his staff: heck, he did pick a bunch of people who think exactly like him.  Regardless, after reviewing the facts it sounds like opposing the deal would be akin to prejudice.\n\nWe can't stop foreign companies from controlling american interests.  The company that is trying to take control of the ports (they will not be providing security mind you) does an excellent and professional job of managing other ports around the world.\n\nOf course I do enjoy watching the republicans rip apart Bush on the issue.  I imagine it will eventually blow over, it's just no one wants to look weak on security during an election year and there are few opprotunities to show that.  This looks like smoke and mirrors to me.

3	How  is keeping a high GPA beneficial to a college student? If employers don't really care, and it doesn't effect financial aid...they why bother working to keep a GPA near 4.0?    \nWhat is the reward for good grades, when 2.5 to 3.0 is sufficient to most employers? (if they ask at all)\n\nI have a 3.67 and am working toward a civil engineering degree.  (Bachelors) If you have extensive job experience, then a low GPA isn't that importatnt.  If you have no job experience, or only one or two jobs, then a high GPA is very importatnt.  It looks good on a resume, and can be the deciding factor between you and another candidate for a job, scholarship, internship, etc.

2	can a peptic ulcer cause heart palpitations? Nice question.\n\nWell, neither peptic ulcer nor any medications used to treat it can cause palpitations.\n\nHowever, there are two weak links. \n\n1.   People suffering from anxiety suffer from palpitations very often. Such people are also prone to increased acid production and hence peptic ulceration. So ask yourself? Are you an anxious person?\n\n2.   Most people who use caffeine excessively (such as tea and cofees and soft drinks) are prone to get acid-reflux disorders including peptic ulceration. Same caffiene can also transiently cause palpitations in susceptible individuals.\n\nI hope that helps.

6	Does anyone know if your renting a room and not on the lease can you be evicted without notice?  (toronto)? do the tenant laws protect me also even if iam not on the lease but subletting?  iam in Toronto Ontario.....thank you Yes and No. Really it will depend on local laws. Usually if a person is receiving mail at a residence for any period of time they are considered a tenant with legal rights. Technically they could not file eviction paperwork as you are not on a lease, unless you sublet, the owner would have to file the paperwork instead. If the owner were to file the paperwork it would have to be for all parties in the rental not just you. Long story short if you really want you have means of fighting it and dragging it out for a lengthy period of time.
1	A car can pump 500 gallons of gas in 20 minutes. How much gas can a car pump in 30 minutes? These are just similar ratios:\n\n500 gallons / 20 minutes = x gallons / 30 minutes\n\n500 / 20 = x / 30\n\nNow solve for x (you can cross multiply if you like):\n20x = 15000\nx = 750 gallons.\n\nIt's also rather intuitive to see that you got 500 gallons in 20 minutes.  So in 10 minutes more, you will pump half again as much.  500 + 250 = 750 gallons.
3	win did president Mirabeu B, Lamar move the capital of texas frome houston to austin? As far as I could figure out, Houston was never the capital of Texas. Austin was originally settled in 1835 and used to be called Waterloo. In 1839, Mirabeu B. Lamar renamed the city to 'Austin' in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the "father of Texas", who negotiated a peace treaty with the local Indians at the site of the present day Treaty Oak after several settlers were killed in raids. At the same time, the city was also chosen to be the capital of Texas.

5	who is the 5th best pitcher ever? ive got cy young, nolan ryan, roger clemens and lefty grove as the first 4, cant decide on the 5th one though. i was thinking catfish hunter? also some good relievers, not just closers though, setup guys  too. i'd go with sandy koufax or satchel paige.\ni dont think nolan ryan should be in your first four, there are a bunch of pitchers better than he was including dizzy dean, christy mathewson, bob feller, greg maddux, juan marichal, walter johnson, tom seaver, don drysdale.\n\nalso, catfish hunter is definetly not better than any of those guys.\n\n\nagain, with the relievers, mariano rivera is simply the greatest. dennis eckersly, gossage, sutter, wagner, others come to mind as great relievers.\n\nbaseball prospectus said that the greatest single season closer-setup combination was the '04 rivera-gordon team.

3	How old r the pyramids of Egypt? what time period were they created? Pyramid construction in Egypt began around 2600 BC, the last known royal pyramid was built in Egypt around 1550 BC.\nGeneral History of Pyramids in Egypt and Nubia:\n\nThe pyramid is thought to have developed out of the mastaba tomb. Mastaba is an Arabic word, meaning bench, which was applied to the flat-topped, slope sided superstructures of tombs. The pyramid is also thought to be associated with solar worship and the "ben-ben" stone which played a major role in sun worship and was vaguely pyramid shaped.\n\nIn the 3rd Dynasty, several mastabas were stacked forming the Step Pyramid of King Djoser. By the 4th Dynasty in the reign of Snefru attempts at building a true pyramid were underway. The pyramids of the 4th and 5th Dynasties, including those at Giza, essentially reflect the further refinement of the pyramid, the chambers within it, and the associated temple complexes. Eventually the standard style was an orientation of east to west (significant in Egyptian religion), with a pyramid temple, located directly on the east side of the pyramid, and a causeway leading to the "valley temple" located near the Nile at the edge of the cultivation.\nWhile it is accepted by reputable Egyptologists that pyramids served as burials for kings, the exact details of the theology behind them remains unclear. One idea, popularized I believe by Dr. Mark Lehner, one of the foremost experts on Egyptian pyramids, is that pyramids served as "resurrection machines" providing all the necessary means for eternal life with the gods for the dead king.\nIn the late 5th Dynasty in the Pyramid of Unas at Saqqara, we have the first appearance of formal texts within the pyramid itself - the appropriately-named Pyramid Texts. These texts are somewhat esoteric and are essentially a collection of spells, stories, and guides relating to the Underworld. Initially these texts were limited to royalty. In succeeding pyramids, elements of the Pyramid Texts were included in the "Coffin Texts" of the First Intermediate and Middle Kingdom and in the "Book of the Dead" of the New Kingdom - texts available to a broad spectrum of society.\n\nPyramid construction continued in the Middle Kingdom - again limited to royalty, but not on the grand scale of the Old Kingdom. The last known royal pyramids located in Egypt are that of King Ahmose, founder of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom (ca. 1550 BCE) and the pyramid-cenotaph constructed for his grandmother, Queen Tetisheri. Both are located at Abydos.\n\nIn the New Kingdom, pyramids came to be part of tombs for reasonably wealthy private individuals - frequently added to the exterior portico area of rock-cut cliff tombs or appearing as architectural elements of brick constructed tombs in varous parts of Egypt.\n\nThe Napatan and Meroitic kingdoms in Nubia (modern Sudan) also used the pyramid for royal burials at sites such as El-Kurru and Nuri. While the Napatan kings ruled Egypt for a time during the 25th Dynasty and were buried in pyramids, those pyramids were located in Nubia proper.\nPyramid Construction:\n\nPyramid construction relied on highly skilled teams of workmen who were housed nearby the pyramid fields - in the Old Kingdom located in the general vicinity of the ancient capital Memphis at sites now knows as Giza, Saqqara, Meidum, and Dashur. A few pyramids in the Middle Kingdom were located near the Fayum, roughly Middle Egypt.\nIn addition to the full-time workmen, there was likely a seasonal labor requirement asked of the lower classes of Egyptian society - a sort of taxation, often referred to by the French term "corvee" labor. This is distinct from slavery. While the ancient Greek historian Herodotus (writing over a thousand years after the construction of the pyramids at Giza) reported that he was told the pyramids at Giza were constructed by slaves, Herodotus was wrong about any number of things in his reports and may not even have visited Egypt

9	How much to tip baggers at the commissary? I never know how much to tip.  Someone told me she tips $1 for every two bags but that is just ridiculous in my opinion. At the express lane I had 2 bags and threw 50 cents in the tip box and the bagger gave me a dirty look and said a snotty "well, thank you". God I hate grocery shopping. The baggers at my Commissary always give dirty looks, regardless of how much you tip them. I give them $1 if i carry my own bags out and $2 if they do it for me. If they don't like it, they can find another job. Tipping them too much defeats the purpose of the lower prices and no sales tax.
5	who can tell me  what drivers caused a caution on purpose? either by throwing something out the window or anything that they could do to bring a caution on to give them a advantage in the race. Track, date, drivers and what they did. not just this seasons, past seasons too. Robby Gordon, October 2006, Atlanta, threw roll bar padding out of his car to get a caution.  Docked 50 owner points, 50 driver points, & fined $15,000.\n\nDale Earnhardt Jr., 2004, Bristol,  intentionally spun himself out to get a caution.\nDocked 25 points & fined $10,000.\n\nKurt Busch, 2002, Charlotte, intentionally spun Jeff Gordon out to get a caution.\nFined $10,000.\n\n\nJust looking at these, I think NASCAR needs to be more  consistent with the penalties they give.
0	How to learn Enlish well?how to improve my Oral Enlish,please? Could you please give me some advice about how to improve my Enlish?I want to learn more oral English.could you please teach me some?I can't wait to improve my Enlish.You know my English is so poor.Thank you for answering. Learning English should be treated in the same way that you learned your mother tongue.\nFirst you learned to listen, to your parents.\nthen you practiced speaking, and learned to speak. Then you learned to read, and eventually to write.\nThe most important thing about learning English is learning to listen.\nListen to English songs, English Radio, and English TV. Then try to imitate what you hear, until it sounds like the speaker.\nReading will help with vocabulary, and writing will help to pull it all together. As suggested by someone else, reading out loud will help too. Keep a diary, in English, and each day write what you have learned. Then you can look back and see your progress, and this will motivate you to continue.
6	what are the merits and demerits of population? I need a detailed answer ,b coz its for my projects Obviously, there is a minimum population beyond which there are simply not enough people to make up a functioning country.  Beyond that, there needs to be enough people to have a fully functional economy.  That is, the major professions and trades must be adequately represented, as well as entrepreneurs and investors, support staff and other service workers, etc.  \n\nOnce there are enough to run the country, you start to see the disadvantages of too much population:  pressure on natural resources and infrastructure, housing and job scarcity, crowding causing delays in transportation, retail trade, etc.  Overpopulation also means a higher percentage of non-productive consumers than the system can most efficiently accommodate.  This causes pressure to create bureaucracy to control the excess population, including the increased crime rate caused by crowding.\n\nI do not know of any studies of what the optimum population is for a given type of geography under a given level of developments, etc., but most of the "civilized" world is overcrowded rather than too sparsely populated.  The only exceptions, like Canada, tend to be those in rather extremes of physical conditions.\n\nEnough to get you started?
9	A QUESTION about immigration? So, I have asked 2 questions this morning, and I have gotten most responses who agree with me.  Some have not, I even got called a racist, which I am upset about. I shared my opinion, and wanted to hear other opinions.  I think most people are with me on where I stand.  I think that ILLEGAL is ILLEGAL no matter what. I don't care what race you are.  I do think we need immigration reform so it is not so hard to do legally. So what do you think. People say, (and I agree) that democrats are not in touch with Americans.  Who do you agree with?  Where do you stand?  BTW.... I am not a racist. I have friends of all races and always have.  Do not judge someone because they disagree with you! I think your 100% right on this one.  We all know that this country was founded on immigrants that came over looking for a better life.  But the difference back then was no one gave them a hand out, they worked hard to get things.  They didn't have forms in their language, they didn't get assistance with anything.  They had to adapt, learn the language and make something of themselves.  Now a days they all want it easy.  The government has to make forms in 10 different languages for them, their kids have to be taught in their foreign language, and about the history of the country they left.  If your so interested in teaching them that then why did you leave your country?  We make it too easy for them.  They don't struggle like other cultures that came over in the 1900's and so on.

9	Is it legal to take a stranger's picture? If I were to take a stranger's picture, and the stranger were to approach me and ask me to tear up or delete the photo, do I have a legal right to refuse?  Does the other person have the legal right to force me to get rid of the photo?  This is assuming the photo is clean (non-nude), of course. Technically, is not legal to take a person's picture if the picture identifies the person. ie: you can tell it is them in the picture. If the face is blurred or it is the backside of a person it is OK and legal.\n\nNow, if that person grants you the rights to their immage it is OK. Obviously, if they prohibit you from taking/using the picture, they do not grant rights of usage. \n\nThis is because a person's image is technically their coppyright. \n\nor at least these are the guidelines that I follow...

9	Why are the minutemen trying to get the african american people to help them?? everybody knows that there is more racism from whites towards blacks.. They're not trying to get the African American people to help them, the African Americans are rushing to their aid, because they are not ignorant losers. They see the FACTS...that there is currently an invasion of the nation that many races share by another nation...and as many issues as blacks and whites have had in the past, the blacks know that the whites who want to protect this nation are not doing so from a racist point of view, but from a sense of needing to protect the nation from that which the government will not. The blacks know that the government doesn't do SH!T for them and that they're allowing what's left of "the good life" in America will be gone if we allow this to continue.

A young oriental girl came in and said she was there witnessing for her spiritual leader " Rev. Sun Yung Moon ". She said she considered him more important than Jesus and as the modern day Messiah. We asked her if we could pray over her and then rethink her devotion to him. She took our challenge and we layed hands on her and asked the Lord to bless and enlighten her. The Spirit of Jesus fell on her so sweetly and she swooned a little as we prayed and then stood there for a while with her eyes closed. She then opened her eyes and with a glazed look on her face, smiling, said she now " liked Jesus better "....She was deeply affected and we were so happy for her we were laughing in joy and bliss. It is great and the angels rejoiced as well.   Praise God.   What Church did this happen at.    Just Curious =)
1	Is fire affected by gravity? I mean seriousley, have you ever seen a flame go down? The flame itself is not affected by gravity.  It will burn as long as there is oxygen present in the right quantities.  The difference is that in gravity, hot air rises.  This allows the air to move upward past the flame and causes the flame to stand 'up'.  In zero gravity, the hot air does not rise as there is no 'up'.  The flame is more of a sphere shape and sputters because the oxygen is being consumed by the flame and the air is not moving.  A normal looking flame can be achieved in space if you artificially move the air by blowing on it or with a fan.

6	What is the cheapest way to ship about 8 boxes cross country weighing about 200 lbs total? No time limit.  UPS is quite expensive.  Any other carrier? I've done this before, and have found UPS to be the best option. Unlike the USPS, UPS actually tracks your packages- the result is that if the USPS loses a package all they can tell you is "better luck next time" while UPS can see where the package was before it was lost and usually the package is located.\n\nYou can also ship packages using bus lines like Greyhound, this can be pretty economical but not as convenient.  All you need to do is get your boxes to the bus station and then pick them up at the station of their destination.  This is a good solution if you aren't shipping anything really valuable or fragile, and you don't mind if the boxes take an extra week to get to you. Call Greyhound (or another bus company) if you are interested.
1	are they complete or incomplete metamorphosis? Do these insects go through complete or incomplete metamorphasis and what are their nymths called?\nExample: fly- incomplete, maggot\n\ncockroach\nsicadis\nbed bugs\ntermites\ndragonflies\nbeetles\nbees\nants\nmosquitos Insects that go through 'complete' metamorphosis are holometabolous and hemimetabolous insects go through 'incomplete' metamorphosis. \nButterflies are the most well known holometabolous insects (Order: Hymenoptera) ie that have larval, pupal and adult stages.\nHemimetabolous species have a number of nymph stages (exoskeleton moults) after hatching from the egg.\nFrom your list cockroaches, cicadas, bed bugs (nasty), termites, dragonflies, beetles, bees and ants are hemimetabolous with only mosquitoes as holometabolous ie they have a riggler (larvae), pupae stage and adult comes out of the pupal case where it splits open along the back of the exoskeleton and the adult pulls itself out.

3	why the  teachers are teaching the materials? are they educators? Teachers teach the material they do because the government tells them to.  They are given objectives that are to be met and have to decide the best way to present the material.  Majority of teachers do try to incorporate different activities or teaching strategies in order to meet the needs of all students.  Smaller assignments, quizzes and in class activities are used to help assess the students understanding and in some subjects a unit test will be given.  THe purpose of a unit test is to evaluate how the student is able to tie EVERYTHING together.  \n\nSome people believe teachers are testing too much but sometimes a test is the only way to truly evaluate what the STUDENT knows.  How many parents "help" their children with the homework?  Some parents complete the homework for the children because they want their child to get a better grade.  Children learn through doing and by making mistakes. The problem with sending home homework is how does the teacher know how much of the work was completed by the actual student.  If the student is only producing a level 2 in class but on homework assignments hands in level 4 work...why does the difference exist?\n\nEducators need to have the support of the family.  A lot of educators do not agree with the current curriculum but have no choice but to follow the guidelines set out.
9	What is the Feminist agenda? The feminist agenda is not about equal rights for women.

6	What, and whom, can be the subject of a  forensic artist who works for the government, finding missing people? The subject of an artist is the person or thing that poses for the drawing.  Mona Lisa was "the subject" of Da Vinci's masterpiece.   The "subject of a forensic artist" could be the following (and I'm sure there are more):\nA missing person where a picture of when they were young existed and the artist had to draw them as they would look today (age them)...\nA missing person who authorities believe may have changed their appearance...\nA dead person whose idenity is unknown so they need to get it out to the media, etc.,\nOr a crime scene.

2	what do you think is wrong when you can't go, you know # 3? the doctor's don't help and i really think they think i'm crazy!! i had a colonascopy done and they said it was abnormal, but they would just watch me. what could be abnormal and why don't they help me. i only go maybe two times a week and thats with a laxitive. what should i do?? i really need help. thank you haha...its #2.  But ok.  There is this thing you can buy.. it is call Kefir...if you have an HEB where you live, I know you can find it there.  It is a yogurt type drink that has active bacteria cultures that aid in your digestive tract.. and help things run more smoothly.  Drink prune juice...that may help.  Also, look for a really good health food store...there are things that you can buy that help replace/ad the proper bacteria and such that you need in your colon.  I know there is a form of it that comes in powder.  You really have to search, and see what you can find in the natural foods/supplements area, especially if the doctors aren't going to help.\nGood luck.\n:)

4	How do I switch my windows xp computer from English to Spanish? You can't, you would need to buy and reinstall the Spanish version of Windows on CD.\n\nIf you only need to configure your keyboard, sort criteria, etc., use the Control Panel to set locale preferences.  These only work for input devices (ie, your keyboard), and not output: you'll still get titles, messages, etc., in English.
4	How do I get a buyer to leave me feedback on eBay? I have several customers that bought from me as far back as last July and still haven't left me any feedback.  I have sent them emails (I was nice!)to ask them to, but no response. I know they received what they bought, because I tracked their packages. Or maybe I should leave well enough alone, and thank my lucky stars I didn't get a negative one!!! Just ask them to please leave feedback. Trust me, i have sold lots of items on ebay and it has positive effects.
8	Do you have the sweetest Husband in the world? My Husband actually brings me flowers for no reason, he's a good Dad, He always compliments me, and he cares more about me when it comes to intimacy. My husband is pretty cool... flowers have completely lost their power over me. My hubby will wash laundry or dishes with out me having to ask, he will get up with the kids and let me sleep in on weekends, he even cooks breakfast and keeps mine warm until I get up. He'll call me on his lunch break just to chat...He does too many sweet things to list here, but I will never take him for granted, he is the greatest husband and father you could ask for.

Dead Again- great noir with Andy Garcia.\n4. Good Will Hunting\n5. La Femme Nikita

Once you are able to communicate properly all your other questions will become very simple.
4	How many searchers regularly use a search toolbar, such as the Google toolbar? I would love to get numbers search engine by search engine for each of their toolbars, but I will take what I can get. I can live with percentage of searches, or number of searches, or number of users that have downloaded. I'll take any data that anyone has. I too use Firefox but I have found the Google Toolbar extremely useful.  It's even more useful because on both IE and Firefox is has a built-in spell checker which I use all the time too.  But for all my searches it's the Google toolbar all the way.\n\nI don't like IE because it doesn't have tabs and because I don't want to download both the MSN desktop search and the new toolbar.\n\nIf you are interested on statistics read this article at Search Engine Watch, http://searchenginewatch.com/reports/article.php/2156431\n\nGoogle has 36.5 percent, MSN has 15.5 percent, AskJeeves has 6.1 percent, Yahoo has 30.5 percent, AOL has 9.0 percent followed by Infospace with 0.9 percent and Others with 0.6 percent combined.

2	What's a new good bicep workout?  I've been lifting for years and want to try something new...? I want to try a new lift to help energize the bicep workout.  I've done almost every variation of curls you can imagine, and some cable lifts too, but are there any lost lifts that I'm missing??? Pullups/chinups. Not only does it work the biceps, but also your lats and shoulders. A lot of back exercises work the biceps too. Barbell or dumbbell rows, cable rows, lat pulldowns will all work your biceps. And squats. It may sound strange, but squats are great for a full body workout. Your body releases a ton of growth hormones just from squats alone, that all your muscles benefit.\n\nAnd don't forget to work your triceps too. They do make up 2/3 of your upper arm, and having well shaped tri's can really make your arms look great!\n\nThe link below is an article called "How Can A Bodybuilder Add Inches To The Arms In The Shortest Time?" It has a lot of good ideas and techniques on overall arm workout (biceps, triceps, and forearms).
4	2wire DSL gateway? my 2wire 1000sw wireless gateway says in the configuration that i can hook upto a phone line and be on DSL and still not hold up my phone does any one know how to do that? Since you are on DSL, you should be able to use the phone and be on the Internet simultaneously regardless of your DSL modem. You just need to connect your computer(s) to your 2Wire 1000sw and install line filters to all of your telephone devices and you should be good to go.\n\nWith a 2Wire 1000sw, you should be able to connect your computer(s) through Ethernet cable, USB cable, HPNA or even wireless.\n\nI recommend that you connect your main computer using an Ethernet cable since it is the fastest and most reliable. \n\nYou can go to http://support.2wire.com for more information.\n\nCheers! :)

1	how to increased the depth of penetration of a magnetic field? When you wrap a coil of wire around an iron bar and pass an electrical current through the bar, you create an electromagnet that is capable of temporarily aligning the iron atoms in the bar.  Perhaps all the atoms are aligned a little.  By increasing the current or adding additional turns to the coil or both the strength (flux) of the electromagnet can be increased and the alignment of iron atoms also increased until saturation when maximum strength is obtained.  Rather than increasing penetration, this is likely more like increasing strength at depth (penetration).

4	how do I remove moviepass.tv from my computer..I'm using XP.? There's 50 odd posts about removing Moviepass but no-one seems to have an answer so I did some research...\n\nI've come up with what I hope is a solution which I've uploaded to here...  http://profend.com/answers/moviepass.html\n\nIt's also here as a Word document... http://profend.com/answers/moviepass.doc  and here as a text document... http://profend.com/answers/moviepass.txt\n\nI'm posting this same message to other people who've asked about removing Moviepass.  Instead of having instructions on lots of posts I've put them on a website so if I need to edit them it'll be much easier.\n\nOne comment that comes up a lot is that people haven't asked for Moviepass, it's just appeared on their computer and they're having great difficulty in removing it.\n\nAdware and spyware removers won't work as it's neither of these - it's an actual program (or more correctly several programs).  Pop-up blockers don't work as it's running on the users machine, not from the internet.\n\nSimply going to 'Add / Remove Programs' and removing it from there doesn't work as there's several 'sub-programs' and files that need removing.\n\nI'd appreciate any feedback: did it or didn't it work, do the instructions make sense or not.  You can e-mail me at <yahooanswers at profend dot com>\n\nHope it works for you.

0	For overseas Muslims, If I were to visit your country as an American citizen and a woman...? would I be required to wear Muslim dress and to cover my hair? (No offense, I'm just learning about Islam, not judging). In the movie "Not Without My Daughter", Sally Field was married to an Iranian man and was still an American citizen, yet she was nearly arrested by some very angry people because her bangs were showing. What would they do if I did not wear Muslim dress, even though I would be a foreigner. (Of course I would wear the customary dress out of respect for the Muslim people, their religion and their country, but I'm curious.) Also, how are American women who are married to a Muslim citizen of whichever Arab country treated? Obviously, we're not too popular overseas these days. Are they ever accepted into society? Hi Tina\nok Tina again it depend on what Muslim country you are going to visit? Muslem  come from diffirent contries,culture,educatons,\nfor example if you will visite Turkey or Tunisia...you can wear any thing you want....but it will be Saudi Arabia or Iran you have to cover your hair...\nfor example i life in Egypt...and about 9% of the Egyption people are Christian and they do not cover their hair and wear what they want and not all the Muslem women in Egypt cover their hair...and Egypt love the tourists coz they increase our national income so in the egyption beatchs and the historical places the touriste can wear any thing they want as they wear in theia contries...i will give you a sit for the Egyption Movies you can see how the egyption people wear in usual\nhttp://www.copticweb.com/aflam/Egyptian%20Arabic%20Movies.html
9	Anyone in the military Please help me!? I am tring to decide what branch of the military to \njoin. I am wanting to know what branch has the best benefits\nand opportunities. Please help. I'm a Air Force wife and think its the best for family benefits. It also seems that we currently have the shortest deployment times (good info if you want to career military and marry/ have kids). The housing is much better, but benefits are very similar to other branches. The biggest bonus to me is knowing my husband is serving in Iraq, but is not on the front lines. The marines are very physical, the Navy....big boat, lots of water, teeny living space. It just depends on your wants and personal phobias. But as a female I'd suggest Air Force. The thought of a female on the front lines and being prisoner/ tortured is just hard to think about. Just listen to the other posters about not believing the recruiters. If I could find my hubby's, I'd strangle him!!! See if you can find a base near you, or put up a question her to talk to other military women in the branch you choose. Personal experience is always better than a smooth talking recruiter.\nAnd check about benefits! Signing bonuses and signing up for 6 yrs instead of 4 and getting more rank for doing it. And good luck! It can be a good career path, or just a chance to grow up and learn alot about yourself.
6	will having too much milk or orange juice give me kidney stones whem im older.? yes.... well, milk + antacids can cause milk alkali syndrome, which can cause stones.  Orange juice cannot.

Atlanta was supposed to host it in the '04-'05 season but I believe that they're hosting it in 2008 now.  Phoenix was supposed to host it this year ('05-'06) but it was cancelled due to the Winter Olympics (which I wasn't happy about because I live in Phoenix).  Comissioner Gary Bettman said that they will host it in several years. Dallas is hosting it next year.
7	The O.C. WIthout Marissa? OK its starting up again tomorrow. I saw previews online and on tv, and it looks pretty good. IDK though alot of ppl Marissa was their favorite character, and with her gone do you think the show will go down the toilet? I was watching the first episode of the new season yesterday. It seems like it is going to pretty good. But Taylor is pissing me off. I just don't like her character. And it is wierd how Marissa is gone. But i like watching how everyone reacts to the situation, Julie trying to relieve her stress by doing he wierdest things, Ryan going back to his life in Chino, and Summer trying to face the facts but still sees Marissa around. I just don't get how she and Seth broke up again. Weren't they together in "The Graduates"?

1	How does a Pow-Wow water cooler heat water instantly? One quick point - this isn't a stupid question, I know that the main function of a water cooler is to provide cold water. However the water cooler where I work also provides boiling hot water for tea, etc. The hot water comes out of the machine as the same speed as the ice cold water; yet it's actually boiling (with visible steam coming off it). How does the mechanism inside the machine work, to provide this function so quickly and efficiently? I can't find anything useful related to this on Wikipedia - so any genuine answers would be very much appreciated; thanks in advance '_' Interesting question, the Nestle website does not give any answers either :(

Just be sure to submit your application electronically, rather than mailing it hardcopy.
1	What makes you dizzy when you spin around and around??? Your middle ear is responsible for your sense of balance.

2	Are lights any better than full flavor Cigs? I know both are un healthy but should I switch, or does it really make no difference? I recently saw a news report saying that they did a study on whether lights were more healthy than full flavour cigarettes and the result was they were the same.  It is merely a marketing scheme to make you buy more because you 'think' it is healthier.\n\nIt is just like having the choice of getting beaten with a baseball bat or a hockey stick.  Both are not good for you.
4	I wanna advertise on my site. How? I want to use something other than Google Adsense. I don't have a credit card number, so the checks must be posted to my door. Any ideas? Offer advertising spaces on your site and have people pay by PayPal (which you can then deposit straight to your bank account). The best way is to have blocks set aside for advertising & have the details listed when you click on them (e.g. "Your ad here")

0	Why do people worry so much? I see, every day, people worrying about everything. They live their lives in a dream, worrying about useless things that won't matter in the end-and what is the end? Death. I once asked a friend what the difference between Humans and everything else on the planet is. I explained that both eat, grow, sleep, and reproduce. I told him the only difference is all the things that humans do in-between, like work useless jobs, make money to put it back into the system, have stress and hate and other useless emotions just to reach the same end as everything else on the planet-Death, in which none of that "useless stuff in between" matters. Why do you worry? because they can

You are limiting your future enjoyment if you choose such a narrow technical field and have a good quiz-solving brain. I do as well and chose a tech field. I am quite good at it but it is very boring now that I have mastered it. I did not realize when I was young that there are hundreds or even thousands of jobs that could be very satisfying to me and that one's personal tastes will always change with age.\n\n   My advice to you is to try and get hands on experience at as many different work related things as you can, never ruling out ANY opportunity to BROADEN your education, no matter how unrelated it may seem to your interests. Techs NARROW their knowledge but it is more fun to live a WIDE life. I promise that you will get a few surprises along the way at what can be enjoyable to you if you don't exclude the possibilities.\n\n   I still love a good puzzle but now I look for them everywhere, and there they are!\n\nGood luck!\nW Kennedy

0	Teach abortion, because abstinence does not work? Please, allow me to explain my question.\n\nMany abortion advocates, (Pro-Choicers) believe teaching abortion in stead of abstinence is necessary.  The reason being, people, (of various ages) will have sex no matter what they are taught. Including rape, people have sex under either of two circumstances: voluntary or involuntary.\n\nIf one believes sex is, (or at least, can be) voluntary, then they must agree that those who voluntarily have sex should be held responsible for their actions. Thus, a man who impregnates a woman must support the woman and child. A man who rapes a woman or child must recieve due punishment for his actions. A woman who is impregnated by consectutal sex must bare responsibilty of her actions.\n\nHowever, if one believes sex is instinctive, (thus, the urge is uncontrolable) how can he hold one responsible for any sexual situation or the results thereof? Should rapist be institutionalized and not imprisoned? Should pedaphiles be pittied?\n\nPlease, explain your answer. If someone is responsible enough to have sex - then they should be responsible enough to handle the consequences. Abortion is the easy way out not to mention murder.

0	What is the best answer that you can give to this question? After pondering my decision for a moment I've decide to answer with the following:\n\nMonkeys like to eat bananas every day and if they didnt they would probably lose all their potassium which could possibly make them lose their hopping abilities and if they lost their hopping abilities they wouldn't be able to hop into trees and eat all the leaves off of the trees which then cause the sun to produce more heat which of course would melt the ice caps and we would all die a slow, painful death from heat exhaustion and those who didnt die would be drowned in the flood caused by the massive melting of the polar icecaps.\n\nSo that's pretty much it so just pray that monkeys keep eating all their bananas!

3	Where can I get the information about constuctions details of retail petrol out lets? I am civil engineer from india and i have 10+ years exp. in building constructions,tendering & estimations etc. Now i have got an offer with Shell to work in their petrolium outlets(retail).I want to know about the constuction details(Work break down sttructure, what are the key (critical) components in retail out lets and shell sfately standard and rules etc).\n\nT & R,\nKP Well, if you want blueprints, you can always go to your local municipal development services office and ask to se them.  They may charge you a few bucks for photocopies but they are essentially public record.  They require no identification or clearance to see and all you have to do is know what you are looking at.  \n\nI used to work in one of those departments.  The blueprints are used to approve construction permits.  Since construction permits are official documents approving development work, they are therefore subject to complete public scrutiny at any time.  They legally cannot prohibit you from making a copy.  \n\nWhen I issued fuel station permits, we had multiple levels of protocols for environmental impact, groundwater protection, surface water runoff, explosion prevention, hazardous materials, fire, etc...  Each of these areas were checked off and cleared by municipal authorities.  While Shell may have standards that they follow, they ultimately must get approval from the local government to build and this approval comes with conformity to either a local, state, or regional standards body.  \n\nHope this helps!
6	How much freedom does a teacher have? How much freedom does a teacher have, as for as hi or her classroom in concerned. For example, can a teacher put anything they want in the classroom, like a plant, artwork, statues, make the classroom into a particular theme, props, fishtank and so on and so on? Yes they can BUT only if it is considered suitable for the age of the students, not offensive to ethnic/religious/ gender (ect.) issues as approved by the school, and safe.  If you have questions about something - like how will other react to it...it's best to consult another teacher or administrator at your school...since they would know the regs and general attitudes of the community.  IF you are using something to demonstrate that may be offensive - inform the parents before hand, and the school admin so that anyone who doesn't wish to participate can be excused; also apologize to the class at the start of the demonstration and explain why you are using this and that you aware that it might be offensive.\n\n~What I'd like to know is what you want to put up...generally for run of the mill decorations there is no set limits that say you can or can't put something up unless it's dangerous to student.  But this may just be at my schools

0	Does your religion tell you not to judge others?? If so, let me tell you that I am a witch and DO NOT worship satan in any way.  So, if you aren't to judge, or hate me why do you?  I don't hurt anyone or push my beliefs on them.  Please answer with your heart not the bible. Hi Kristy,\n\nI understand that Wicca does not actively serve the devil. \n\n(To be honest, I doubt anyone really actively serves diabolical forces. Who in their right mind would? )\n\nAnd I know a lot of motivation of Wicca is good -- my guess is that it wants to preserve nature, it wants to free people from destructive emotions, it offers a sense of peace and aesthetic beauty, it tries to remedy society's negative views of women, and so forth. \n\n(Please excuse my ignorance if I mistated something... or feel free to clarify something I missed.)\n\nI think most of the people here are simply thinking that a person either serves "God" or they don't, just as a person either serves Wicca or they don't. And by not actively serving the purposes of one, a person is automatically serving the purposes of the other.\n\nI think the distinction is extremely important, though, in how we relate to each other; and telling someone they "serve the devil" is a pretty lousy way to build relationships, or show concern for and interest in each other. I know I'd be turned off if someone said that about me, especially if my intentions were good.\n\nAs far as the verse you refer to ("Judge, lest ye not be judged..."), the context isn't saying that a person cannot come to an opinion about someone else and their behavior. People always come to conclusions, it's part of life. \n\n(After all, you yourself have just made a judgment: You've judged other people as wrong because you perceive they're judging YOU, right? My point is that it's impossible to live life without constantly "judging" other things at that level. We HAVE to make some judgements just in order to live.) \n\nJesus IS saying (very specifically) that, before I worry about fixing someone else, I need to look even harder at myself and see what needs fixing in ME. \n\n("Why focus on the speck of dust in your brother's eye, while you have a beam sticking out of yours?" That's one of Jesus' hyperbole's here. "You goofball, take the beam out of your own eye, so that you can see clearly on how to help your brother fix his.")\n\nThe person who evaluates someone else as needing help has to first evaluate himself and at least acknowledge (if not deal with) his own issues first. Otherwise our intentions are in the wrong place.

3	why the trees seems to be moving backward when we are in travelling? They dont. If they really seemed to be moving backward then we wouldnt be travelling. They would be moving backward-that is-if they travelled away from our back.\nTo prove they dont seem to be moving backward when we are travelling, look backward as you are travelling-at that point You are moving backward and the trees cannot seem to be moving forward if the trees seem to be moving backward to the driver. We travel and the trees remain constant. This knowledge allows our mind to accept the tree is not moving and that precludes the mind from thinking the tree is seemingly moving at all.Except for wind or whatever.

Good power supply (500W and good quality = key)\nGet an AMD 64 3000+ (or beyond) chip to save money and not run as hot\nYou can get a 300+ GB SATA hard drive for ~$200\nGet a motherboard that supports USB 2.0, SATA, eSATA, and PCI-E.\nA gig of ram is fine, get the highest speed you can afford.\nMight as well get a DL DVD burner, they're like $60 bucks and well worth it.\nAlso, might want to get a good case thats easy to work in, stays cool, and is reasonably quiet.

He may be a nice man but an age difference of that much means you two probably don't have very much in common. Your friends and his would be too far apart in age too. Those two factors should be taken into consideration. You also said you thought he was was way too old for you. If you go out on a date, he will get the idea that his age doesn't matter and obviously it does, not only to you but your whole family.

3	When do you use the word "sit" and the word "set"?  Also "lay" and lie"?  This has always stumped me!! Sit and Lie and reflexive verbs. That means that you do it to yourself only. When you sit down you sit yourself down. You can't sit down for somebody else. When you lie down, it's always yourself you are lying down. You can't lie something else down. \nBy the same token, Set and Lay and transitive verbs. This is when the verb is an action taken(by the subject)on the object. You don't set yourself down, you sit down. Anyone who thinks that a person can 'set' down is incorrect. Lay is also a transitive verb. You can't lay yourself down. This is one that most people use incorrectly. Lay is a transitive verb, meaning you can lay something else down, but not yourself. You lie yourself down. \nWhen I hear people say 'I'm going to lay' I always think of a chicken, laying an egg.  \nDoes that help?
2	what are the risks involved if one conceive just after abortion,before next period? Probably normal risks associated with any pregnancy.  You shouldn't have sex 1-2 weeks after an abortion.  There may be a higher risk of infection.\n\nIf you just had an abortion, make sure you're using contraceptives (condoms, IUDs, the Pill, etc) so you can avoid another abortion.  Prevention and protection is the best way to go.  Abortion should not be used as a repetitive contraceptive.\n\nTalk with your physician or head back to the clinic where you had your abortion.
1	Explain what is happening when you come in contact with extreme cold that damages you skin, re: hypothermia.? Hypothermia is a dangerous drop in your body's core temperature. FROSTBITE is when your skin/tissue is damaged by cold. Basically, the water in your tissue freezes. Ice crystals damage/destroy tissue cells, and the cells die. If you get serious enough frostbite the skin turns black - meaning the tissue is dead. Which is why fingers and toes need to be amputated... to prevent the spread of gangrene.

It helped so much. I was still nervous but really just know that when you get out there you are in charge and they are there to see you. Give them a performance they won't forget. Give yourself a bit of an "i'm awesome" additude. If it helps. :o)
0	For those who believe God is a myth...? is he the most important myth of our time? Hm - good question.\n\nI think the myth of an optimum political-economic system would probably be a stronger contender (at least in the developed world).\nThe myth of progress (ie. that "progress" is always a good thing) is another likely one.\n\nOn a mythos (rather than philosophical) level, the Star Wars films are probably the great global myth of our time (kids in all kinds of countries/languages know all the details - far more intensely than they know about any version of God).\n\nGod was probably the most important myth of previous times, but hasn't been for a while. Another good question might be "When did God cease being the most important myth?"\nSome time between the Enlightenment and the French Revolution?

We should not wish anything for someone that we would not  want for ourselves. we are lucky to be born here maybe we would see things diffrent if we had to leave our homes to give our familys a better life. Don't believe in religion, so mark that down as a no.

6	what does yahoo mean? The word "Yahoo" was originated in English by Jonathan Swift in his tremendously influential novel of 1726, "Gulliver's Travels." In Gulliver's fourth journey, he visited a land populated by an intelligent race of horses called the Houyhnhnm, who are completely controlled by reason and rational thought. They dominate the a race of hideous beasts known as Yahoos, who are human beings in the same form as Gulliver. Gulliver soon befriends the Houyhnhnm despite his own Yahoo-like appearance and soon loathes the race of Yahoos. When he returns home at the end of his voyage, since the Houyhnhnms no longer are able to keep this Yahoo-like creature around, the novel ends darkly with Gulliver despising all human interaction and longing for the horse race. "Yahoo" is a term for a human being who is crude and boorish in all his desires.\n\nThe founders of Yahoo! have stated that the term they selected is an acronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Object," since their fledgling Yahoo! project was just another one of those internet sites assimilating information into digital form.

1	what evidence did james watson and francis crick use to deduce the structure of DNA.? GraemeW mentioned Rosaline Franklin and he is exactly right to do so!  Without her work with X ray defraction, which Francis and Crick stole from her, they probably wouldn't have been the discoverers of the DNA double helix structure.  Linus Pauling probably would have beaten them to it.\nFranklin took a "picture" of the structure of DNA that showed its structure to be a double helix.  They knew the chemical compostion from tests that had been run, and they figured up the pairing of the bases by using cardboard cut outs.

4	Spam New Graphic site how does it effect me once opened? Is this a virus? a worm? once I open the email and it copied my email address book, what else does it do? It only affect yahoo mail users.  Delete it without trying to open it.  Just opening it will get you infected.  It is a spammer virus designed to harvest email addresses.  The email has the following attributes:\n\nFrom: {last victim}\nSubject: New Graphic Site\nMessage body: Note: forwarded message attached.\n\nTo clean your system, shut down your browser.  Then restart and erase all your cached files. In IE, go to TOOLS->INTERNET OPTIONS then click DELETE FILES under the Temporary Internet Files Section.  Restart the browser again.\n\nThe virus is a javascript based virus so it will affect ALL computers including MACs and LINUX boxes.  It is a worm that goes by the names JS/Yamanner@MM [McAfee], JS_YAMANER.A [Trend Micro], and JS.Yamanner@m[Symantec].\n\nOnce it runs, the virus scans all your yahoo mail folders for email addresses.  It sends all email addresses it finds to the spammer at the following web site "www.av3.net/index.htm" (don't go there or you'll be infected).  Then it resends itself to all yahoo.com and yahoogroups.com email addresses that it found.\n\nAgain, if you see a message with the subject "New Graphic Site" in your email, don't try to read it or else you will be infected.
6	Is it possible to get an english degree online. Or could one still work and study for one part time? Hi any help would be great. I am 19 and very very ambitious where I live job and career prospects are limited. I have a huge love for Japan and wanted to live there for such a long time now. I have an English G.C.S.E grade B  but I know I need a degree if I am to teach in a Japanese school. Please help me if you can. http://www.elearners.com/online-degree/5702.htm?tsource=it&tid=67027\n\nYou can always work and attend college part time if you can afford it.  I would recommend that you get your GE out of the way at your local Junior College (usually it is much less expensive than a four year or an online university).  The link above will take you to an online college that offers a degree in English.  You can sign up for more information.  I was surprised that some online colleges cost more per unit than the 4 year universities.  You'll need to contact them to find out their costs.

0	OTHER THAN THE BIBLE... what historical information is there on Jesus? I asked that same question and while looking up other religions, wondering to myself if I was the only one who doubted those ideas and pretty sure, there are not very many other religions accepting Jesus as a real figure. However, other religions do believe that there is one god, but worship different forms of it. As like catholics do with Mary, god, the holy spirit, Jesus. SO as Christians, baptists, Pentecostals, catholics etc. all think that they are the right religion and only believe in one god, so do all the others. No one feels like having an open mind and exploring that all religions are the same, but just look at the mountain from a different side.

3	how do i mack a resume at home? Below are some sample resumes for your reference:\n\nhttp://www.resume-resource.com/samples.html\n\nHere are some tips:\n1. If you have less than 10 years of experience, you want your resume to be one page.\n2. Generally, clearly show your name, mailing address, email address if available, and best phone number(s) to contact you.\n3. Then show your education, work experience, any interests, achievements, and skill sets. Under your work experience, it is not a list of your job descriptions (this is a common mistake). You should instead indicate what you have accomplished and the results.  Use action verbs.\n4. If you are looking for your first job or intend to change job function / industry, you may want to state your objectives.\n4. There is no one “correct” format.  It depends on your profession and personal style.\n5. Also, try not to use technical words and jargons. Do not abbreviate.\n\nYou can post your resume at:\nhttp://www.monster.com\nhttp://www.careerbuilder.com\nhttp://hotjobs.yahoo.com\n\nOther good references are:\nhttp://www.vault.com\nhttp://www.wetfeet.com\n\nI would also go to your bookstore and find a resume book in the business/career section. You can also find more examples and templates online if you do a search.\n\nGood luck and have a nice day.
1	Read this please and give me the answer you think is correct.? Homer can type twice as fast as MArge. Together, they can type 100 pages in 3 h. How long does it take each person, working alone, to type 100 pages? This is simple algebra.  The rate thing 100 pgs / hr is a number as much as any number.  If we say X is the rate Marge types then Homer types at 2 * X and your equation is\n\n100 pgs/ 3 hrs = (2 * X) + X = 3 * X\n\nsolving for X we get Marge typing at 11.11 pgs/hr and Homer typing at 22.22 pgs/hr - So Marge will take 9 hours to do 100 pages on her own and Homer 3 hours.
6	what are EBAY challenges right now? what strategy should the management employ to overcome those challenges? eBay faces a lot of challenges right now. Once it was the darling of internet stocks, but not anymore.\n\n1. Its main auction model is slowing as ebay faces maturity = to achieve growth, it will have to do so not with its auction site but its acquisitions such as Paypal and eBay. Forbes Magazine has an interesting article on this   http://www.forbes.com/markets/equities/2006/05/08/ebay-skype-0508markets04.html\n\n2. Stiffer competition particularly abroad = early this year, eBay had to scrap seller transaction fees in China due to significant competition from Alibaba.com. Even in Korea, Yahoo is aggressively challenging eBay  http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=17139&hed=Yahoo+Challenges+eBay+in+Korea\n\n3. Sellers are looking for other (cheaper) channels to sell their products = ebay's fees are continuously rising, and sellers are looking for ways to sell their items. They are flocking to ebay's competitors or creating their own ecommerce site\n\n4. Competition from Google = Google has developed GBuy or Google Checkout, which is its main challenge to Paypal http://www.forbes.com/markets/2006/06/09/google-0609markets09.html
2	after the procedure how long to wait to do home test for pregnancy? after 10 days of abortion and no sex, i did home pregnancy test and it came out "pregnant" but all the other signs, like the morning sickness, hard to swallow, being ofended by small smels etc... are gone and i feel health. so how long i have to wait to do the home test or is something wrong with me? It is a difficult call because after any pregnancy - whether live birth, stillbirth, miscarriage or abortion, one still sees positive home pregnancy tests for up to eight weeks following the birth or loss. \n\nThe only way to determine if you are in fact pregnant right now would be to ask for a blood test. If your levels are up, you will be asked to return the following week to see if those initial levels have doubled. If that happens, you are pregnant. If the levels stay the same or drop, you may have been recently pregnant again or just have lingering hCG hormone in your bloodstream from your last pregnancy\nhttp://www.anairhoads.org/bc/pregabort.shtml

4	When is Mafia 2 going to release???? Although a popular topic of rumors, whether there will even be a Mafia 2 has not been confirmed. A release date is usually set by the developer when they can reasonably expect that their predictions will hold true. When games have not yet been confirmed, this usually means that the developers are not sure if they will release it or even start working on it.\n\nIn the mean time, play Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven.
7	Who has seen "An American Haunting" and how was it? I was also at the screening at the Arclight theaters and I have to say how bad it really was. It was trying so hard to be the next great American horror film. The music was so redundant and overdone. And yes there were little girls with long black hair AGAIN in some scenes. The POV of the spirit is the lamest thing I've ever seen. It's also very redundant. The whole dream/nightmare/memory thing...whatever it was...felt so unnecessary and redundant. There's so much redundancy and boredom to this film. The only reason why I jumped at some parts and many times why I do this in horror movies is because of the loud music. Who doesn't jump at sudden bursts of trumpet sounds? And Rachel-Hurd Wood was not that great either. She was much more believable in Peter Pan. She needed a rougher edge to her character and I think her innocence in real life bleeds through too much in her character. There was also a very awkward scene where she does the whole "twitching-I'm possessed-help me" act and the family is just staring and edited in a way that makes them look so careless. I couldn't help but laugh. Her whole twitching thing looked so fake as well. For some reason that moment totally made me picture the director shouting out his commands "scream! shake harder..HARDER!!" And Donald Sutherland can not act in this as well. And Sissy Spacek I feel like just wants money. She hasn't been in anything good since In the Bedroom. Story's pretty weird. For devil's sake....it's the same director as Dungeons and Dragons. He was ranting on to a select few of us outside the theater of the plot points and why people did this and that. No one can possibly know that the first viewing. Ok..enough of my ranting. I think with a lot of smart editing, and different choices of music placing, this film can be somewhat good.
6	What are honduras resources? bananas
3	I know we can reserve a room, or reserve a seat, but can we reserve a train or reserve a hotel? If you have enough money, then you can pretty much reserve whatever you want anymore. Well, every hotel and/ or train is going to be different- some will say yes, and some will say no. But you STILL have to be able to pay for it, so yes you do need to be talking about whether or not you can afford it. Sory if my answer wasn't correct, but I only saw the question - I didn't see a question about your grammar.

3	Teaching a Language? What are some essential things you must teach when teaching a language to someone else? For example: i am teaching someone english, who speaks spanish. I obviously speak spanish, but are there any suggestions / things i need to know before i start? like strategies, how to approach it, etc. thanks a lot! You need to establish for what purpose they are learning English. There are threee main areas to language; speaking, & listening, reading then writing.  It takes longer for non native speakers to sound native once they reach around age 12, on the other hand the true second languge learner (one who already reads, write and composes in correct gramatical form in their native language) will be able to comprehend and produce more content area language than younger learners.  Younger than 12 year olds will sound more like native English speakers at an amazing rate but may have little to no idea what they are saying. If your Spanish speaker already is a literate Spanish language learner there will be alot of transfer (translation & relation) to their native language.  The easiest thing to do is find out what they know alot about that you also know alot about (perhaps the Bible, Hollywood movies, music) and do lessons/conversations around this topic.  Provide as much illustrations and props as possible.  Good luck from a second language learner & teacher=:

2	pulled muscle? my mum has just pulled a muscle washing her hair, its down her left side, she is in pain and it's taking her breath away? what could this be? should she see a doctor? If it's confirmed that this is a pulled muscle, go out quickly and buy a tube of arnica gel, preferably A.Vogel or Roberts. These are the ones available at health shops and better chemists. I don't find the Weleda so effective. \n\nAs you rub it in to the pulled muscle the skin feels very cold and within five minutes there is quite a dramatic reduction of pain. Keep massaging it in a few times a day and the pain will go quicker than if arnica not used. Arnica gel is used by physios on sports injuries to muscles.
8	how do u know when the love is real? Its true, you can't really explain it. You may fall in and out of love many times in life and think its real. The human emotion is tricky. If you were going through a bad patch and someone is nice to you, you may think its love.\nSome people confuse lust with love. Its not necessarily the butterflies in the stomach or you smile every time you think of that special someone.\n\nI think you will know it by feeling. We are all individual. What I think is real love to me, might not be for you.
0	Who do you go to for advice? go according to nature of problems, like see a doctor for health advice, ask a mechanic if got a car won't start, something like that...
8	can someone help me? i just got asked out by this totely hidious guy but the problem is hes really nice but i don't like em how do i tell him no without completely crushing him "Oh, thanks for asking, but I don't have the same feelings for you.  It's very sweet of you to ask, but no."\n\nDo this privately, and never discuss it with your friends or anyone else.  What is "crushing" to boys is the humiliation of girls talking about them and saying things like, "eww, gross, he asked me out but I wouldn't touch him with a ten-foot pole," etc.\n\nJust have a little respect for both him and yourself and you'll be fine.  Remember that you are helping him to learn that life goes on after disappointments, which is critical to building confidence.
